YBF9c2mCGME,1,"Are you struggling to pass the CompTIA Security Plus exam? Or maybe you just want to test your knowledge before the big day. Well, you are in the right place. Today, we are diving into 50 must know Security Plus practice questions with full explanation to help you crush the exam on your first try. Whether you are prepping for the test or just sharpening your skills, these questions will challenge you and reinforce what really matters. Stick around till the end because I will explain not just the answers but why they are correct. And if you are serious about passing, I also have a free full Compia Security Plus course right here on this channel. Check the description for the link. All right, let's jump in. Your Security Plus success starts now. Question number one. To enhance the security of their virtualized environment and prevent VM escape attacks, an organization is implementing several security measures. Which of the following actions should be included in their security strategy? Select two options and the options are option A enforcing resource allocation limits for virtual machines. Option B, regularly patching the hypervisor and virtualization software. Option C, disabling unused virtual network adapters. And option D, implementing a zero trust security model. And the correct options are option B regularly patching the hypervisor and virtualization software and option C disabling unused virtual network adapters. And the explanation is so to defend against VM escape attacks where a malicious virtual machine breaks out of its sandbox to interact with the host or other VMs organization should number one regularly patching the hypervisor and virtualization software. So this is the most critical measure. VM escape attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in the hypervisor. So keeping the hypervisor and virtualization software updated closes known security holes and number two disabling unused virtual network adapters. This reduces the attack surface by preventing unnecessary communication channels between VMs and external networks and minimizes potential for lateral movement or data. So let me further clarify it with the help of this diagram. So"
YBF9c2mCGME,2,"for lateral movement or data. So let me further clarify it with the help of this diagram. So this is how the virtualization works. So at the base we have the hardware on top of the hardware we have the hypervisor and on that hypervisor then we make different virtual machines. So basically the hypervisor is the controlling mechanism or the operating system that control resources to the VMs as well as their communication and these VMs are not supposed to directly interact with the hypervisor or with the other VMs without any control mechanism. So if due to any security vulnerability the VMs are able to escape from there this sandbox environment and the VM is able to access the host that is hypervisor or other VMs then these type of attacks are known as VM escape attacks because the VM is able to escape from its own sandbox environment. Question number two. A financial services company is designing a new transaction processing system. The system must be capable of handling high volumes of transactions without any downtime and must also efficiently distribute processing loads. Considering the requirements of high availability, fall tolerance and efficient load distribution, which of the following technologies should be implemented? Again we have to select two options and the options are option A load balancing, option B clustering, option C single server deployment and option D redundant power supply. And the correct options are option A load balancing and option B clustering. And the explanation is so for a high volume transaction processing system that requires a high availability fall tolerance and efficient load distribution the following technologies are essential. Number one load balancing. The load balancing distributes incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers. This ensures efficient resource utilization, improves response times and supports fall tolerance by res by rerouting traffic away from failed server. What does this mean? This means that if we have let's suppose three servers on the top we have load balancer. So the load balancer distribute traffic among these server and if due to any reason one of the server fails the traffic is no longer sent to this"
YBF9c2mCGME,3,"server and if due to any reason one of the server fails the traffic is no longer sent to this server rather it is rerouted and distributed among the remaining servers. Number two clustering. So clustering involves grouping multiple servers to work together as a single system. This provides high availability and fall tolerance and if one server or node fails other can take over without service interruption. Question number three. A large corporation recently deployed a new enterprise resource planning that is ERP system. Post deployment, the IT team discovered compatibility issues with existing applications causing disruptions in business operations. This situations highlights a failure in the change management process. What should be the primary focus to improve change management practices for future deployments? And the options are option A conducting comprehensive user training sessions post deployment. Option B, increasing the budget for future IT projects to allow for more advanced solutions. Option C, implementing a thorough testing and validation phase before deployment. And option D, focusing exclusively on the speed of deployment to minimize downtime. And the correct option is option C implementing a thorough testing and validation phase before deployment. And the explanation is so the primary failure in this scenario is that compatibility issues with existing applications were not identified before deploying the new ERP system. This indicates that the testing and validation phase were either inadequate or skipped altogether. So a thorough pre-eployment testing phase helps identify compatibility and integration issues, stimulate the production environment and reduce the risk of post deployment disruptions. So this is a core component of effective change management process. Question number four. In determining the annualized loss expectancy that is a for various risks in a corporate network, what factors should the risk management team consider in their calculations and we have to select two options and the options are option A the cost of cyber security insurance premiums. Option B, the potential financial impact of each identified risk. Option C, the frequency of occurrence for each identified risk. And option D, the budget available for implementing security controls. And the correct options are option B the potential financial impact of each identified"
YBF9c2mCGME,4,"available for implementing security controls. And the correct options are option B the potential financial impact of each identified risk and option C the frequency of occurrence for each identified risk. So let me go through the explanation. So analyzed loss expectancy that is Ale is calculated using the formula. So, Ale is equal to SLE that is single loss expectancy multiplied by ARO that is analyzed rate of occurrence where SLE or single loss expectancy is equal to the financial impact of a single occurrence of a risk and a rate of occurrence is equal to the expected frequency the risk will occur in a year. So together these give a monetary estimate of expected annual loss due to a specific risk. Question number five. A company prevented direct access from the database administrators workstation to the network segment that contains database servers. Which of the following should a database administrator use to access the database servers? And the options are option A jump server, option B radius, option C HSM. HSM is hardware security module and option D load balancer. And the correct option is option A jump server. So what is a jump server? A jump server, also called a jump host or a jump box, is a secure server that acts as an intermediary between you and the servers on a network. It's like a stepping stepping stone you use to securely access more restricted areas. This adds security by analyzing access. You manage access through one point that is the jump server limiting exposure. Internal servers are not directly accessible from the internet and providing audit trails logs track who accessed what adding security investigations. So this is how a jump servers looks like that. Suppose you are somewhere remote and you want to access this database servers through internet. So uh allowing this database servers to be accessed directly through internet is a security hazard. So what the organization will do that the remote administrator would first log onto the jump server and then from jump server he or she can access and manage the organization resources. So this jump server is a centralized access server that is hardened and"
YBF9c2mCGME,5,"access and manage the organization resources. So this jump server is a centralized access server that is hardened and allows only authorized users and services to be accessed. Question number six. A company is deploying a firewall to enhance its network security. Security team must choose between a firewall that operates primarily at layer 4 and one that functions at layer 7. What is a key advantage of selecting a layer 7 firewall for the purpose and why it why might it be more suitable for the company's needs? And the options are option A, a layer 7 firewall is faster because it processes less data compared to a layer 4 firewall. Option B, a layer 7 firewall provides application level security, offering more granular control over web traffic. Option C, a layer 7 firewall is easier to configure and requires less maintenance than a layer 4 firewall. And option B, a layer 7 firewall focuses on physical security, protecting network hardware from damage. And the correct option is option B. So a layer 7 firewall provides application level security. Remember application resides at layer 7 offering more granular control over the web traffic. And the explanation is that a layer 7 firewall also known as an application layer firewall operates at the top of the OSI model and provides the pecker inspection. This allows it to understand application protocol like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and DNS etc. Inspect content and context such as specific URLs, user actions or commands and apply fine grain policies based on user identity, application behavior or content. This makes layer 7 firewalls especially useful for modern network environments where threats often hired within legitimate application traffic. So this is a visual representation of layer 7 firewall. So this is the network traffic and you can consider this as a layer 7 firewall. So this level seven firewall understand the protocols. It can inspect the content flowing through and you can apply application level policies through this firewall such as let's suppose you can apply that the HTTP traffic should be blocked while the"
YBF9c2mCGME,6,"through this firewall such as let's suppose you can apply that the HTTP traffic should be blocked while the secure HTTPS traffic will be allowed through this policy application of layer 7 firewall. Question number seven. A corporate security analyst discovers that confidential company information has been leaked online. After investigating the analyst finds spyware installed on several executives laptops which has been capturing keystrokes and screen activity. What is the most likely method through which the spyware was installed on these laptops? And the option are option A. The executive visited compromised websites that automatically downloaded the spyware. Option B, the company's email server was hacked and spyware was directly installed. Option C, an insider intentionally installed the spyware on the executives laptops. And option D, the executives use unsecured public Wi-Fi networks leading to the spyware installation. And the correct option is option A that is the executive visited compromised websites that automatically downloaded the fware. And the explanation is so this is a classic case of a drive by download attack where simply visiting a malicious or compromised website can trigger the automatic download and installation of spyware without user interaction. This method is common in real world spyware attacks expires vulnerabilities in the browser or plugins often used to target high value individual such as executives. Why other options are less likely? Option B, the company's email server was hacked. So this is this is unlikely as hacking the email server would not directly result in spyware installation on laptop. Option C an insider intentionally installed. So while possible there is no evidence in the scenario to suggest insider involvement. And option D the executive use unsecure public Wi-Fi. The public Wi-Fi may expose users to man in the middle attacks, but it does not directly install spyware unless paired with other clients. Question number eight. NIT manager discovers that the organization's data encryption standards are outdated, potentially exposing sensitive data to security risk. Considering the principles of due diligence and care, what is the most appropriate action for the IT manager to"
YBF9c2mCGME,7,"Considering the principles of due diligence and care, what is the most appropriate action for the IT manager to take? And the options are option A, ignore the issue assuming the risk is minimal. Option B, inform senior management and propose updating the encryption standards. Option C, wait for security incident to occur before taking action. And option B transfer the responsibility to another department. And the correct option is option B inform the senior management and propose updating the encryption standard. And the explanation is so under the principles of due diligence that is being aware of risk and due care that is taking action to mitigate those risks. The IT manager is obligated to identify the outdated encryption as a risk. Proactively communicate this issue to senior leadership and recommend updating the standards to align with current best practices and compliance requirements. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, ignore the issue. This violates both due diligence and due care, exposing the organization to avoidable risk. Option C, wait for a security incident. So reactive behavior shows negligence and may result in legal liability or data breaches. And option D transfer the responsibility avoiding accountability without action breaches. professional and ethical responsibilities. Question number nine. An organization's internetfacing website was compromised when an attacker exploited a buffer overflow. Which of the following should the organization deploy to best protect against similar attacks in the future? And the options are option A NG firewall that is next generation firewall. Option B W AF that is web application firewall. Option C TLS that is transport layer security and option D SD van that is software defined wide area in network and the correct option is option B web that is web application firewall. So this is how a web application firewall works. So let's suppose this is your destination server. These are our clients and the web application firewall or web sits between the server and the client so that it filters all the traffic and only allows the legitimate traffic while block the unnecessary or malicious and suspicious web traffic. So a web or web application firewall acts as a"
YBF9c2mCGME,8,"block the unnecessary or malicious and suspicious web traffic. So a web or web application firewall acts as a security guard for your web applications. It sits between your web app and the internet monitoring and filtering people. Here is the gist. So it blocks malicious traffic. Web can identify and block attacks like SQL injection and cross-sight scripting that trying to steal data or manipulate your application. Focuses on application layer. So unlike firewalls that guard your entire network, web application firewalls specifically target attacks aimed at web application and it protects for from common threats. So web application firewalls are a defense against many well-known web application vulnerabilities. Question number 10. When implementing and managing antivirus solution in an organizational settings, which two of the following best practices should be prioritized to maximize the effectiveness of the antivirus software? Select two options and the options are option A, regularly updating the antivirus software with the latest virus definitions and software patches. Option B, disabling realtime scanning to improve system performance. Option C, ensuring that antivirus software is installed on all endpoints, including mobile devices and servers. And option D, limiting user privileges to prevent the installation of unauthorized software. And the correct option is option A regularly updating the antivirus software with the latest virus definitions and software updates. And option C ensuring that antivirus software is installed on all endpoints including mobile devices and servers. And the explanation is so to maximize the effectiveness of antivirus solutions in an organization the following best practices are critical. A regularly updating the software antivirus software with the latest virus definitions and software pages. This ensures protection against new and evolving threats and software software patches address vulnerabilities in the antivirus program itself. Ensuring that antivirus software installed are all endpoints including mobile devices and servers. Comprehensive coverage ensures no device becomes a weak point. Mobile devices and servers can be targeted in attacks just like the desktops. Question number 11. During a routine audit, it discovered that a recent network configuration change although minor was implemented without going through the formal approval process. This"
YBF9c2mCGME,9,"discovered that a recent network configuration change although minor was implemented without going through the formal approval process. This change inadvertently created a security vulnerability that was exploited leading to a data breach. What does this incident primarily highlight about the importance of the approval process in change management and the options are option A the need for continuous monitoring and automated security systems. Option B, the significance of following protocol for even minor changes. Option C, the importance of regular security training for IT staff. And option D, the relevance of having a robust incident response plan. And the correct option is option B the significance of following protocols for even minor changes. So the scenario describes a change made without following the formal approval process which resulted in a security vulnerability and data breach. This directly highlights the importance of adhering to proper change management protocols even for what may seem like minor modification. Option A, C and D are generally important for security but are not the primary lesson emphasized by this incident. Question number 12. A financial institution contracts a thirdparty IT firm to upgrade its transaction processing system as outlined in a detailed statement of work or S. So, the S. So, includes specific security requirements and deadlines. Halfway through the project, the institution realizes that the firm is not meeting these specified security requirements. What is the most appropriate initial action for the institution to take in this situation? And the options are option A, immediately terminate the contract and seek legal action. Option B, engage in discussion with the firm to address non-compliance with the S so or statement of work. Option C, overlook the security shortcomings to avoid project delays. And option D take over the project and complete the upgrade internally. And the correct option is option B engage in discussion with the firm to address to address non-compliance with the statement of work. So the most appropriate initial action when a third party vendor is not meeting contractual requirements is to communicate the issue and attempt to resolve it collaboratively. The S so is a binding document and the"
YBF9c2mCGME,10,"communicate the issue and attempt to resolve it collaboratively. The S so is a binding document and the vendor should be held accountable but engaging in discussions allows the institution to clarify expectations, reinforce compliance and possibly get the project back on track without escalation. Option A, immediate termination and legal action is a last resort after attempts to resolve the issue fail. Option C, overlooking security issue is negligent and could lead to compliance violations or data breaches. And option D, taking over the project is drastic and may not be feasible without breaching the contract. So option B demonstrates due diligence and good vendor management. Question number 13. An organization's email security system automatically quarantines a batch of emails that are suspected of containing fishing links. Upon manual review, the IT team finds that some of these emails are legitimate business communications. What is the most likely reason for this mclassification and what action should the organization take to prevent such occurrences in the future? And the options are option A inate spam filters update email security spam filter settings. Option B overly aggressive quarantine settings fine-tune the email security systems heristics. Option C, lack of user training. Conduct a fishing awareness training program. And option D, malfunctioning antivirus software replace the antivirus solution. And the correct option is option B overly aggressive quarantine settings fine-tune the email security system heristics. So the issue described is false positives that is legitimate email being incorrectly flagged as fishing. This most commonly occurs when the email security system heristics or filtering thresholds are too strict. Fine-tuning these settings helps improve accuracy and reduce disruptions to legitimate business communication. Option A is incorrect because it's not about inadequate filtering but over filtering. Option C relates to user behavior not system level mclassification and option D is unrelated antivirus software is not responsible for email quarantine rules. Therefore option B addresses both the cause and the best corrective action. Question number 14. A small business has recently implemented a new customer relationship management that is CRM system. After a data"
YBF9c2mCGME,11,"A small business has recently implemented a new customer relationship management that is CRM system. After a data breach, it is found that sensitive customer data was exposed. In this scenario, who should be identified as the risk owner for the CRM system and what action should they prioritize? And the options are option A the customer service manager focusing on customer communication and support and B the sales manager concentrating on mitigating potential sales impact. Option C the IT administrator focusing on securing the CRM system and preventing future breaches. And option B the marketing manager focusing on reputation management and public relations. And the correct option is option C, the IT administrator focusing on securing the CRM system and preventing future breaches. And the explanation is so the risk owner is the individual responsible for managing and mitigating risks associated with a specific asset in this case the CRM system. Since this system involve technical infrastructure and data security the IT administrator is best positioned to understand the technical vulnerabilities and implement security controls. Option A, customer service manager is responsible for handling affected customers but not for managing the technical risk. Option B, sales manager may face business impact but is not responsible for system security. And option D marketing manager may handle PR that is public relation but again not the risk owner of the system itself. So thus option C is the correct and most appropriate choice. Question number 15. An online retailer has noticed a pattern of fraudulent transactions originating from certain IP addresses to effectively monitor and identify such activities in the future. Which detective control should the security team focus on implementing? And the options are option A installing a web application firewall that is web. Option B setting up a system for realtime transaction monitoring. Option C implementing two factor authentication for customer login. And option D conducting regular vulnerability assessments. And the correct option is option B setting up a system for realtime transaction monitoring. And the explanation is so detective controls are designed to identify and alert on suspicious activities after they occur or while they are in progress. A real-time transaction monitoring system helps detect fraudulent patterns"
YBF9c2mCGME,12,"after they occur or while they are in progress. A real-time transaction monitoring system helps detect fraudulent patterns such as repeated transactions from flagged IP addresses and enables timely responses. Option A web that is web application firewall is a preventive control that blocks malicious web traffic. Option C, two factor authentication is also a preventive control aimed at securing login. And option D, vulnerability assessments are proactive but not detective. In this context, they help find weaknesses not detect ongoing fraud. Therefore, B is the correct detective control to address the issue. Question number 16. A security analyst is reviewing the following logs. So these are the logs. As we can see some user are trying to login but the login are rejected. We have different login names but same password is used against different login names. So which of the following attacks is most likely occurring where same password is checked or tested against different login names? The options are option A password spraying, option B account forgery, option C pass the hash and option B brute force. And the correct option is option A password spring. So what is password springing? So the log shows multiple usernames being attempted with the same password that is string 2023. This pattern is the characteristic of a password spraying attack where an attacker tries a common password across many accounts to avoid account lockout mechanisms. Option B account forgery involve creating fake accounts not what's happening there. Option C, pass the hash is an attack using hash values, not plain text passwords. And option D, brute force usually targets one account with many passwords, not multiple accounts with one password. So password string is using one password against many users and brute force is using one user and testing is are checking it against many password. So option A is most likely attack occurring based on the logs that is password spring. Question number 17. During a security training session, a company emphasizes the importance of verifying the identity of callers requesting sensitive information. The trainer highlights a recent case where an attacker"
YBF9c2mCGME,13,"importance of verifying the identity of callers requesting sensitive information. The trainer highlights a recent case where an attacker impersonating a vendor obtained confidential contract detailed over the phone. This scenario underscored the necessity of which security best practice to prevent similar wise fallbased attacks. And the options are option A using caller ID verification. Option B, implementing strict call logging procedures. Option C, enforcing a policy of not discussing sensitive information over the phone. And option D, establishing a verification process for phone call requests. And the correct option is option D establishing a verification process for phone call requests. And the explanation is so the attack described is a form of social engineering specifically wishing that is wise fishing where attackers impersonate trusted individuals over the phone to extract sensitive information. The most effective best practice to prevent such attacks is to verify the identity of the caller using a defined process. for example, call backs to official numbers asking for pre-established codes and internal validation, etc. So, option A, caller ID can be spoofed and is not reliable on its own. Option B, call logging helps in audits but does not prevent attacks. and option C blanket policy is impractical for many business functions. So therefore option D is the most appropriate and effective preventive measure. Question number 18. An engineer needs to find a solution that creates an added layer of security by preventing unauthorized access to internal company resources. Which of the following would be the best solution? And the options are option A RDP server, option B jump server, option C proxy server and option D hypervisor. And the correct option is option B jump server. So we already studied about jump server in a previous question and the explanation is so a jump server or jump box acts as a security secure intermediary between external networks and internal company system. It requires users to authenticate before they can access internal resources thereby adding a layer of security and controlling access to sensitive systems. Option A, RDP server provides remote access but does not add a separate security boundary."
YBF9c2mCGME,14,"systems. Option A, RDP server provides remote access but does not add a separate security boundary. Option C proxy server handles traffic routing and filtering n internal resources access control. And option D, hypervisor manages virtual machines not access control for internal resources. So jump server is best for secure controlled access to internal systems. Question number 19. An internet service provider that is ISP implements softwaredefined networking that is SDN to dynamically manage its network traffic and provide customized services with the increasing threat of cyber attacks. What is the most effective strategy to ensure the security of the SDN architecture against potential vulnerabilities? And the options are option A limiting the use of SDN to non-critical network segments only. Option B regularly updating and patching the SDN software components. Option C increasing the bandwidth of the network to handle more traffic. And option D relying on client side security measures to protect the network. And the correct option is option B regularly updating and patching the SDN software components. And the explanation is so in a software definfined networking SDN architecture. The control plane is centralized and softwaredriven making it a critical target for attackers. The most effective security strategy is to regularly page and update the SDN software to fix known vulnerabilities and protect against exploits. Option A, limiting the SDN use reduces benefits without truly addressing the vulnerabilities. Option C, increasing bandwidth is unrelated to security. and option B relying on client side security neglects protecting the SDN's own infrastructure. So option B ensures the SDN systems remain resilient against evolving threats. Question number 20, a company's IT department is implementing a new password storage system for enhanced security to safeguard the password against potential breaches. The IT department must choose an appropriate method for storing them. Which of the following is the most secure way to store user passwords? And the options are option A, storing passwords in plain text in a secured database. Option B, encrypting passwords using asymmetric encryption algorithm. Option"
YBF9c2mCGME,15,"in plain text in a secured database. Option B, encrypting passwords using asymmetric encryption algorithm. Option C, hashing passwords using a strong cryptographic hash function. And option D, saving passwords in an encrypted file with a master password. And the correct option is option C, hashing password using a strong cryptographic hash function. And the explanation is so the most secure and widely recommended method for storing passwords is to hash them using a strong oneway cryptographic hash function. For example, brypt argon 2 or PBKDF2. This ensure that even if the password database is compromised, the plain tech password cannot be easily retrieved. Option A, plain text storage is highly insecure even in a secured database. Option B, symmetric encryption allows decryption which poses a risk if the key is explored. And option D, encrypted file with a master password still relies on reversible encryption and centralized risk. So hashing plus salting is the best practice for protecting stored password. Question number 21. In an effort to maintain compliance with industry regulations, a financial institution has implemented automated guard rails to manage configurations and access rights in its cloud environment. After deploying a new application, it was found that the application could not connect to a critical database. What should the IT team investigate first to resolve this issue? And the options are option A the automated guard rails setting for overly restrictive configurations. Option B the application code for potential bugs. Option C the physical server hardware for faults. And option D, the employee training program for gaps in cloud knowledge. And the correct option is option A the automated guardrail setting for overly restrictive configurations. And the explanation is so the scenario involve a new application that cannot connect to a critical database and the organization recently implemented automated guard rails to control configurations and access. These guardrails may be too restrictive inadvertently blocking necessary access. Option B application code is secondary. If access is blocked by guard rails, the code won't matter. Option C, hardware is irrelevant in a cloudbased context"
YBF9c2mCGME,16,"the code won't matter. Option C, hardware is irrelevant in a cloudbased context and option D training programs won't directly fix the immediate connectivity issue. So the first step is to check the guard rails for example identity and access management roles, security groups and firewall rules to ensure they are not denying needy access. Question number 22. A security analyst is reviewing alerts in the seam related to potential malicious network traffic coming from an employes corporate laptop. The security analyst has determined that additional data about the executable running on the machine is necessary to continue the investigation. Which of the following logs should the analyst use as a data source? And the options are option A application, option B IPS/IDS that is intrusion prevention system and intrusion detection system, option C network and option D endpoint. And the correct option is option D endpoint. And the explanation is so to investigate a potentially malicious executable running on a specific machine. The analyst needs detailed visibility into the processes and behavior on the endpoint itself that is the employees laptop. Endpoint logs from EDR tools or local logging agents provide information like executable names and paths, process activity, file creation or modification, registry changes and user activity on the system. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, application refers to logs from installed application. For example, office custom applications which are not likely to provide detailed process level information on malware. Option B, IPS and IDS focuses on networkbased intrusion detection and prevention which is good for identifying suspicious traffic but not process level details. and option C network provides insight into traffic patterns not what executable is responsible for generating them to understand what exec what executable is running and what it's doing endpoint logs are the right source question number 23 a physical security assessment of a corporate office building reveal that emergency exits are not clearly marked and some are obstructed. This poses a safety risk to employees. What is the most appropriate action for the company to take in response to this finding? And the options are option A,"
YBF9c2mCGME,17,"appropriate action for the company to take in response to this finding? And the options are option A, installing additional CCTV cameras throughout the building. Option B, conducting a comprehensive review and update of emergency evacuation procedures. Option C, implementing a key card access system for all doors. And option D, designating a security officer to monitor emergency exits. And the correct option is option B conducting a compre comprehensive review and update of emergency evacuation procedures. So the core issue identified is that emergency exits are not clearly marked and are obstructed which directly affects the safety and evacuation capability of employees in the event of an emergency. The most appropriate response is to review, update, and enforce proper evacuation procedures, including ensuring all exits are clearly marked and unobstructed, conducting regular safety drills, and complying with fire and building codes. Why the other options are less appropriate? Option A, CCTV cameras enhance surveillance but do not address the safety and usability of emergency exits. Option C, key card access systems improve access control, not emergency. And option D, assigning a security officer may help, but it's a reactive measure, not a systematic fix. So clear functional emergency exits and updated evacuation procedures are critical to life safety compliance. Question number 24. A company purchase cyber insurance to address items listed on the risk register. Which of the following strategies does this represent? And the options are option A accept, option B transfer, option C mitigate and option B avoid. And the correct option is option B transfer. So cyber purchasing cyber insurance is a classic example of risk transfer strategy. Instead of bearing the full financial impact of a cyber incident, the company shifts that is transfers that risk to insurance provider who will cover certain cost if an incident occurs. The breakdown of the other options, option A, except the company acknowledges the risk and chooses to do nothing. Option C, mitigate. The company take steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk that is through firewalls or through training and option D"
YBF9c2mCGME,18,"to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk that is through firewalls or through training and option D avoid the company eliminates the risk entirely often by not engaging in the risky activity. So insurance is basically the transfer of financial risk to a third party through the purchase of cyber insurance. Question number 25. What are the key considerations when using a wildcard SSL/TLS certificate for a domain and its subdomains? Select two options. Option A, the certificates ability to secure multiple subdomains under a single domain. Option B, the color scheme of the websites using the wildcard certificates. Option C, the need for consistent security practices across all subdomains. And option D, the preference for specific web hosting services. And the correct options are option A the certificates ability to secure multiple subdomains under a single domain and option C the need for consistent security practices across all subdomains and the explanation is so option A while SSS/TLS certificates are designed to ensure to secure a primary domain and all of its first level subdomain for example steric.acample.com example.com. This reduces management overhead and simplifies deployment. Option C. Since all subdomains share the same certificate availability in one subdomain can affect all others. Therefore, it's essential to apply consistent security practices across all subdomains to minimize risk. What are the incorrect option? Option B, the color scheme of websites has no relevance to SSL/TLS certificates. And option D, while some hosting services may have preferences, wildcard certificates are not tied to specific hosts. Question number 26. Multinational corporation uses key escro to manage the encryption keys of its overseas branches due to legal requirements in different countries. The corporation must be able to provide encrypted data to law enforcement upon request. How does key escro assist in meeting these legal obligations? And the option are option A by decentralizing key management to each branch. Option B, option B by encrypting all data transmissions between branches. Option C by providing a backup of all"
YBF9c2mCGME,19,"option B by encrypting all data transmissions between branches. Option C by providing a backup of all encryption keys and option D by enabling authorized retrieval of encryption keys. And the correct option is option D by enabling authorized retrieval of encryption keys. And the explanation is so key escro is a security arrangement where encryption keys are stored securely by a trusted third party or system allowing authorized entities such as law enforcement to retrieve those keys when legally required. This supports compliance with data disclosure laws in various jurisdictions. So why the other options are incorrect? Option A, decentralizing key management is unrelated to key escrow which centralizes key storage for controlled access. Option B key escrow is about key storage not encrypting transmissions and option C while backups may be part of the system the key point is controlled access not just backup. So keys pro is basically controlled and authorized access to encryption keys when required. Question number 27. An IT manager inform the entire help desk staff that only the IT manager and the help desk lead will have access to the administrator console of the help desk software. Which of the following security techniques is the IT manager setting up? And the correct options are option A hardening? Option B employee monitoring, option C, configuration enforcement, and option D least privilege. And the correct option is option D least privilege. So lease privilege is a security principle that ensures users are granted only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their job functions. By restricting admin console access to only the IT manager and help desk lead the manager is limiting elevated privileges to only those who truly need them. the other options. So option A hardening involves reducing system vulnerabilities. For example, disabling unnecessary services, closing ports, not access control. Option B, employee monitoring refers to tracking user activity, not restricting access. And option C, configuration enforcement applies to maintaining system settings or baselines not access levels. Though restricting access is applying the principle of least privilege. Question number 28. Which of the following is the most"
YBF9c2mCGME,20,"is applying the principle of least privilege. Question number 28. Which of the following is the most likely to be used to document risks responsible parties for those risk and the threshold of these risk. And the options are option A risk tolerance, option B risk transfer, option C risk register and option D risk analysis. And the correct option is option C risk register. So what is a risk register? A risk register is a formal document used to identify, assess and track risks. It typically includes description of risk, responsible parties for those risk that is risk owner, risk levels or thresholds, mitigation strategies and risk status updates. Question number 29. A corporate security analyst discovered that confidential company information has been leaked online. After investigating, the analyst finds spyware installed on several executives laptops which has been capturing key strobes and screen activity. What is the most likely method through which this five was installed on these laptops? So I think this questions we have already gone through uh this same question but let me uh reread and reiterate it. So that you remember it. Option A, the executive visited compromised website that automatically downloaded the spyware. Option B, the company's email server was hacked and spyware was directly installed. Option C, an insider intentionally installed the spyware on the executive laptops. And option D, the executive used unsecured public Wi-Fi networks leading to the spyware installation. And so this is a test. You must also remember the correct option and the correct option was option A. The executive visited compromised websites that automatically downloaded the spyware. So the most likely method for spyware installation in this scenario is a drive by download where visiting a compromised malicious website causes spyware to be downloaded and installed without user interaction. Executives are common targets for such attacks due to their access to sensitive data. Why the other options are less likely? Option B, email server hacked. While email can be a vector for malware, there is no indication that email was"
YBF9c2mCGME,21,"email server hacked. While email can be a vector for malware, there is no indication that email was involved or that malware was put directly this way. Option C, insider threat is possible but less likely unless there is evidence of intentional misuse or insider access. And option D, unsecured Wi-Fi using public Wi-Fi may expose traffic but does not directly lead to spyware installation unless combined with other attacks. So drive by download from compromised websites remain a common and plausible method for spyware infection especially for highprofile users such as CEO or other executives. Question number 30. A company is expanding its threat surface program and allowing individuals to security test the company's internetf facing application. The company will compensate researchers based on the vulnerabilities discovered. Which of the following best describe the program the company is setting up? And the options are option A opensource intelligence, option B bug bounty, option C red team and option D penetration testing. And the correct option is option B bug bounty program. So a bug bounty program is a structured initiative where a company invires external researchers often ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities in its system typically offering financial rewards based on the severity of the findings. So why the other options are incorrect? Option A, open-source intelligent or OS and involves gathering publicly available information not actively testing systems. Option C, red teams refers to internal or hard offensive security teams that simulate real world attacks usually without prior notice. And option D, penetration testing is a formal scored assessment usually done by contracted professionals not open to the public. So bug bounty is equal to external security testing with rewards for vulnerability discoveries. Question number 31. Which of the following threat actors is the most likely to use large financial resources to attack critical system located in other countries? And the options are option A insider, option B unskilled attacker, option C nation state and option D activist. And the correct option is option C nation state. So a nation state threat actor is typically backed by a government and"
YBF9c2mCGME,22,"option is option C nation state. So a nation state threat actor is typically backed by a government and has access to significant financial, technical and human resources. These actors often target critical infrastructure or systems in other countries for purpose such as espionage, disruption or strategic advantage. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, insider operates from within the organization and usually does not target foreign systems. Option B, unskilled attacker, also known as a script kitty, lacks the capability for complex or well-funded attacks. And option D, he activist is motivated by ideology not typically wellunded and less likely to conduct advanced crossborder attacks on critical systems. So nation state actors are sophisticated, well resourced and capable of high impact international cyber attacks. Question 32. A healthcare provider is audited for compliance with health andure probability and accountability act that is HIPPA. The audit reveals that patient records are accessible by all staff members and there is no tracking of who accesses the records. Which two of the following measures would the health care provider implement to address these compliance issues? Select two options and the options are option A encrypt all patient records. Option B implement role based access control. Option C, conduct regular security awareness training for staff. And option D, establish audit logs for access to patient records. And the correct options are option B implement role based access control and option D implement establish audit logs for access to passion records. And the explanation is so under HIPPA health care provider must limit access to protected health information that is PHI and track who accesses it. So option B role based access control or arbec ensure that only authorized personnel based on their job function can access patient records reducing unnecessary exposure. And option D, audit logs provide the ability to monitor and trace access to passion data, helping detect unauthorized data access and supporting compliance audits. Why the other options are in why the others are less appropriate for this issue? Option A, encrypt all patient records. While encryption is important for data security,"
YBF9c2mCGME,23,"for this issue? Option A, encrypt all patient records. While encryption is important for data security, it does not control or track access within the system. And option C, security awareness training is helpful for general compliance but does not directly fix the issue of unrestricted and untra. So HIPPA compliance is minimum necessary access plus accountability through auditing. Question number 33. After a series of unexpected security incidents, a company is enhancing its incident response plane. Which two of the following actions should be included to effectively prepare for and respond to unexpected security incidents. Select two options and the options are option A conducting regular disaster recovery and business continuity drills. Option B installing more surveillance cameras throughout the company premises. Option C training employees on the identification and reporting of security incidents. And option D ensuring all employees have unrestricted access to incident response documentation. And the correct options are option A conducting regular disaster recovery and business continuity drills and option C training employees on the identification and reporting of security incidents. So to effectively prepare for and respond to unexpected security incidents, a company should focus on proactive planning and employee readiness. Option A, disaster recovery and business continuity drills. These ensure that systems and teams are ready to respond quickly and effectively when incidents occur, minimizing the downtime and impact. And option C, employee training equips staff with the knowledge to recognize and report incidents early which is crucial for limiting damage. Why the other options are less appropriate? So option B, surveillance cameras help with physical security but does not directly address broader incident response for cyber threats. And option D, unrestricted access to incident respond documentation increases risk of misuse or unintentional disclosure. Access should be limited to relevant personnel. So effective incident response is equal to prepared team plus practiced procedures. Question number 34. When assessing the security features of a trusted platform module that is PT TPM, which of the following functionalities are directly related to the capabilities of the TPM? Select two options and the option are option A generating and storing cryptographic keys, option B scanning"
YBF9c2mCGME,24,"TPM? Select two options and the option are option A generating and storing cryptographic keys, option B scanning files for viruses and malware, option C providing hardwarebased attestation of the systems integrity and option D optimizing the performance of the operating system and the correct options are option A generating and storing cryptographic keys and option C providing hardwarebased attestation of the systems integrity and the explanation is so option A generating and storing cryptographic keys. So TPM or trusted platform modules are specifically designed to securely generate store and manage cryptographic keys in the hardware. This is one of their core functions. Option C providing hardwarebased attestation of the systems integrity. So TPMS can measure and report on the integrity of the system during boot for example BIOS or boot loader to ensure no tampering has occurred. This is known as remote attestation. Incorrect options. Option B scanning files for viruses and malware. This is a function of antivirus software not TPM and option D optimizing the performance of the operating system. So TPM does not optimize system performance. It's focused on security not performance. Question number 35. A newly appointed board member with cyber security knowledge wants the board of directors to receive a quarterly report detailing the number of incidents that impacted the organization. The systems administrator is creating a way to present the data to the board of directors. Which of the following should the systems administrator use? And the options are option A packet captures. Option B vulnerability scans, option C meta data and option D dashboard and the correct option is option D dashboard and the explanation is so a dashboard is a best tool for presenting highlevel summaries and visualization of data specific specifically for nontechnical stakeholder like a board of director. It can show metrics such as number of incidents per quarter, severity and types of incidents, trends or time and response and resolution times. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, packet capture is too technical and low level. These are raw network data used by analysts for deep inspection. Option B, vulnerability scans."
YBF9c2mCGME,25,"level. These are raw network data used by analysts for deep inspection. Option B, vulnerability scans. These show potential weaknesses, not actual incidents or their impact. And option C, metadata. Metadata is descriptive data about other data. For example, timestamps, file origin, not a clear summary of the incidents. Question number 36. A file integrity monitoring tool has alerted a system administrator that the hash of CMN cmd.exe has changed. The administrator reviews operating system laws and confirm that no patches have been applied in the past 2 months. What is the most probable cause of this change? And the option are option A, a snapshot of the file system was taken. Option B, the end user changed the file permission. Option C, a rootkit was deployed. And option D, a cryptographic collision was detected. And the correct option is option C, a root kit was deployed. So a change in the hash of cmd.exe texe is a core Windows system file without any legitimate updates or patches is a strong indicator of tempering or malware infection. Rootkits are advanced form of malware that often replace or modify system binaries like cmd.exe to hide their presence or maintain control. Why other options are incorrect? Option A, a snapshot of the file system was taken. So, taking a snapshot does not change the file contents or hashes. Option B, the end user changed the file permission. Changing permission also does not alter the files content or hash. And option D, a cryptographic collision was detected. So collision in modern secure hashing algorithms like star 256 are extremely rare and not a practical explanation here. Question number 37. In NAS that is infrastructure as a service cloud environment considering the shared responsibility model which entity is accountable for the security of the company's database and the options are option A third party vendor option B DBA that is database administrator option C cloud provider and option D client and the correct option is option B client. So in the AAS that is infrastructure as a"
YBF9c2mCGME,26,"client and the correct option is option B client. So in the AAS that is infrastructure as a service model the cloud provider is responsible for securing the infrastructure for example networking storage and compute resources but everything built on top of that like the operating system databases and application is the responsibility of the client. So the client is ultimately accountable for the security of their database including the database access controls, encryption, patching the database software and backup and recovery. Question number 38. A client has requested a document from a security company that covers the project scope, pricing, and timeline. Which document is most appropriate for the company to furnish? The options are option A MSA, option B SLA, option C BPA and option D S O and the correct option is option D S O W that is statement of work. So a statement of work or SO is the appropriate document because it defines the project scope, outlines, outlines the deliverables and timelines, include pricing and payment terms, describes responsibilities of both parties and it is commonly used in service contracts to clearly communicate what is being delivered, when and at what cost. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, MSA that is master service agreement covers general terms and condition for ongoing business relationships not specific project details. Option B SLA that is service level agreement defines service performances metrics like uptime, response time, not pricing or project scope. And option C BPA right is business partner agreement is used to define long-term business relationships not project specific details. Question number 39. A penetration test report shows that a web application form field is susceptible to crossite scripting. To mitigate this vulnerability, which application security technique should the security analyst advise the developer to implement and the options are option A version control, option B code signing, option C secure cookies and option D input validation. And the correct option is option D input validation. So cross-sight scripting or XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted user input is processed and reflected back into a web"
YBF9c2mCGME,27,"scripting or XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted user input is processed and reflected back into a web page without proper sanitization. The most effective mitigation is to validate and sensiti sanitize input to ensure that no malicious scripts can be injected. So input validation involves checking and cleaning user supplied data to ensure it conforms to expected formats and types preventing injection of harmful code. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, version control helps track code changes, not prevent vulnerabilities like XSS. Option B, code signing ensures code integrity and authenticity, not input sanitization. And option C, secure cookies protects cookies from unauthorized access but does not address XSS or cross- site scripting in formal fields. Question number 40. Which of the following must be considered when designing a high availability network? Choose two option and the options are option A ease of recovery, option B ability to patch, option C physical isolation, option D responsiveness, option E attack surface and option F extensible authentication and the correct options are option A is of recovery and option D responsiveness. So when designing a high availability network, the goal is to ensure minimal downtime and continuous service availability. Key considerations include ease of recovery. So systems should recover quickly when quickly from failures. This includes automatic failover, redundancy, and backups to ensure services are restored with minimal disruption. and responsiveness is a highly available uh network must maintain low latency and fast response times even under failure conditions or during rerouting. Question number 41. Before applying a high priority patch to a production system, what is the initial step a technician take? And the options are option A air gap the system, option B move systems to a different network segment, option C create a change control request and option D apply the page to the system. And the correct option is option C. Create a change control request. And the explanation is so before making changes to a production system especially uh applying a high priority page it is essential to follow proper procedures. The first step is to create a change"
YBF9c2mCGME,28,"a high priority page it is essential to follow proper procedures. The first step is to create a change control request. So this ensure that the change is documented, reviewed and approved and communicated to all stakeholders. It also includes risk assessment, scheduling, testing plans and roll back procedures if something goes wrong. So why the other options are incorrect? Option A, air gap the system so drastic and unnecessary unless responding to an active compromise. And option B, move the system to a different network segment. This may be part of containment or mitigation plan not the first step for a routine patch. And option D, apply the patch to the system. So skipping the change control would result in unplanned downtime, conflicts or audit issues. Question number 42. During incident response, what is the primary purpose of conducting a root cause analysis? And the options are option A to eradicate any trace of malware on the network. Option B to discover which systems have been affected. Option C to prevent future incidents of the same nature. And option D together indicators of compromise for the investigation. And the correct option is option C to prevent future incidents of the same nature. So the primary purpose of a root cause analysis during incident response is to identify the underlining cause of the incident not just the symptoms. Use that information to improve defenses, close gaps and prevent recurrence of similar incidents. So root cause analysis focuses on long-term solutions rather than shortterm fixes. So why the other options are incorrect? Option A to eradicate any trace of malware on the network. So this is part of eradication not root cause analysis. Option B to discover which systems have been affected. This is part of scoping the incident done earlier in the response process and option D to gather indicators of compromises for the investigation. So gathering indicators of compromise helps in detection and investigation but not the main goal of root cause analysis. Question number 43. A user within a company network tries to access www.estsite.com testsite.com and receives a"
YBF9c2mCGME,29,"A user within a company network tries to access www.estsite.com testsite.com and receives a certificate mismatch warning in their browser but experiences no such issues when visiting ww.anestite.com another testsite.com. What type of attack does this scenario describe and the options are option AL twin, option B onpath, option C domain hijacking and option DNS poisoning. And the correct option is option DNS poisoning. So in this scenario, the user receives a certificate mismatch warning when accessing an HTTPS site, which typically indicates that the domain does not match the certificate presented, which is a strong sign of DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing. DNS poisoning involve altering DNS records to redirect user to malicious or unauthorized servers. When the browser attempts an HTTPS connection to the spoofed IP, the SSL/TLS certificate does not match the expected domain, triggering a mismatch warning. So why the other options are incorrect? Option A, evil twins refer to a rogue Wi-Fi access point mimicking a legitimate one. Option B, onpath or men in the middle involves intercepting traffic between two parties, but it does not typically cause certificate mismatch unless combined with other attacks like DNS spoofing. And option C, domain hijacking involve taking over control of a domain name usually at the registar level, not just altering DNS resolution locally or via poisoning. Question number 44. To prevent users from accessing unauthorized removable media, which of the following tools is most effective? And the options are option A cable lock, option B, Faraday cage, option C USB data blocker and option D proximity reader. And the correct option is option C USB data blocker. So USB data blocker is a physical device that connects between a USB port and a USB device to block data transfer while still allowing power to pass through. This effectively prevents unauthorized data access or exfiltration from removable media like USB drives. It is most effective when users are allowed to charge devices but should not transfer or access data. You want to prevent"
YBF9c2mCGME,30,"effective when users are allowed to charge devices but should not transfer or access data. You want to prevent access to or from unauthorized USB storage devices. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, cable lock prevents physical theft of equipment, not data transfer via USB. Option B, Faraday cage blocks all wireless signals not USB or removable media access. And option D, proximity reader used for physical access control, for example, doors, not removable media control. Question number 45. Which of the following best exemplifies a social engineering tactic that prays on an individual's feeling of urgency? And the options are option A, S, missing message stating a package is scheduled for pickup. Option B, a fishing email stating a case settlement has been awarded but will expire soon. Option C, a spam a notification claiming to be undercover law enforcement investigating cyber crime. And option D, a wishing call that requests a donation to be made to a local charity. And the correct option is option B. A fishing email stating a case stat settlement has been awarded but will expire soon. Why this is correct option? So this example clearly uses urgency as a social engineering tactic. It pressures the target to act quickly before they have time to think critically or verify the legitimacy. The message creates fear of missing out that is FOMO by saying the settlement will expire soon prompting impulsive action. Why the other options are less accurate? Option Amishing about package pickup. So praise more on curiosity or convenience not urgency. Option C sp from law enforcement relies more on fear and authority not urgency. And option D, wishing call for charity donation uses empathy or guilt, not specifically urgency. Question 46. A security analyst while investigating an application breach through logs discover the following entry. So this is the entry that the security analyst discovers. So what type of attacks has been identified? The options are option A cross-side scripting, option B DL injection, option C API attack and option D SQL injection. And the"
YBF9c2mCGME,31,"scripting, option B DL injection, option C API attack and option D SQL injection. And the correct option is option D SQL injection. So the log entry shows a classic SQL injection pattern. This payload is attempting to manipulate the SQL query by injecting R 1 is equal to 1 which is a true condition. If the input is not properly sanitized, it can cause the application to bypass authentication or expose data. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, cross-sight scripting involved injecting JavaScript or HTML, not SQL. Option B, DLL injection, a technique used to inject malicious dynamic link libraries into processes unrelated to web URLs or SQL queries. And option D, AP, option C, API attack. While API attacks can include SQL injection, this is not specifically an API request, but rather a web form injection. Question number 47. An audit revealed that personally identifiable information that is PII is being used in the development environment of a crucial application. Chief privacy officer that is CPO insist on its renewal but developers are concerned that real data is essential for functionality testing and specific data surging. What is the most effective solution a security professional can implement to meet both the CPO's directive and the development team's needs and the option are option A data tokenization option B data encryption option C data anonymization and option D data masking and the correct option is option D data masking so data Masking is the most effective solution in this case because it replaces the real personally identifiable information with realistic but fictional data preserving the structure and format needed for development and testing. It ensures compliance with privacy regulations by preventing exposure of actual sensitive data. And it allows developers to test functionality and perform data searches using mass data that behaves similarly to real data. Question number 48. A company is developing a data loss prevention solution that is DLP solution on its file server which contains PII that is personally identifiable information, financial and health data. The company intends to apply different DLP rules based on"
YBF9c2mCGME,32,"personally identifiable information, financial and health data. The company intends to apply different DLP rules based on the type of data. What is the crucial first step the company should take to achieve this objective? And the options are option A assign the application owner, option B perform a risk analysis, option C classify the data and option D mask the data. And the correct option is option C classify the data. So the crucial first step in applying different DLP rules based on the type of data for example PII financial or health data is to classify the data. This means identifying and labeling data types according to the sensitivity and compliance requirements so that DLP policies can be tailored appropriately for each data category. Without classification, the DLP solution won't know how to treat different types of data. Why the other options are incorrect? Option A, assign the application owner. important for accountability but not the first technical step towards enforcing DLP policies. Option B, perform a risk analysis. It helps understand overall risk but does not enable technical enforcement of DLP rules by data type. And option D, mask the data. It is a mitigation step not helpful unless data has already been classified and you know which data to mask. Question number 49. A report delivered to the chief information security officer that is CESO shows that some user credentials should be exfiltrated. The report also indicates that users tend to choose the same credentials on different systems and applications. Which of the following policies should the CISO use to prevent someone from using the exfiltrated credentials? And the options are option A MFA that is multiffactor authentication, option B lockout, option C time based login and option D password history and the correct option is option A MFA that is multiffactor authentication. So when user credentials are exfiltrated and reused across multiple systems, the best defense is multiffactor authentication or MFA. MFA adds a second layer of security beyond just a username and password such as"
YBF9c2mCGME,33,"or MFA. MFA adds a second layer of security beyond just a username and password such as one-time code, biometric verification or smart token. Even if an attacker steals valid credentials, MFA prevents access without the second factor. It directly addresses the risk of credential reuse and credential theft. Why the other options are less effective? Option B, lock out prevents brute force attacks but does not stop attackers with valid stolen credential. Option C, timebased login restrict access to certain times but does not prevent credential abuse outside those times if within allowed windows. And option D, password history prevents users from reusing the old password but does not stop attackers from using current stolen credentials. Question number 50. A large enterprise is optimizing its network infrastructure with the implementation of load balancers. The network team is tasked with configuring the load balancer to enhance both performance and security. Which two of the following configurations should be applied to achieve these objectives? Select two options and the options are option A configuring the load balancer for contentbased routing to efficiently distribute specific types of traffic. Option B, setting up the load balancer to double as antivirus scanner for incoming traffic. Option C, implementing health checks on the load balancer to ensure traffic is sent to operational servers. And option D using the load balancer to perform rate limiting to prevent excessive traffic from overwhelming the servers. And the correct options are option A configuring the load balancers for contentbased routing to efficiently distribute specific types of traffic and option C implementing health checks on the load balancer to ensure traffic is sent to the operational servers. The explanation is so option A the contentbased routing has the performance benefits. So routes prefer based on content that is URL paths headers ensuring requests are handled by the most suitable servers. This helps optimize resource usage and response times. Health checks reliability benefit benefit ensures traffic is only sent to healthy operational servers preventing downtime and degraded performance. It improves availability and overall network resilience. So that's all for this video."

G0NCHag1rKc,2,everything we have to offer to help you pass we're going to go over who I am I go by the networking Guru online that's my online Persona and of course my company trip of Technologies and then the last tidbit is how to pass the first time my best tips and tricks to pass the first time you take the Security Plus exam and then of course where to test just go over Pearson view uh testing okay so CompTIA CompTIA is a vendor neutral it and cyber security certification company it's now for-profit now okay I should put a little as there but what CompTIA is is there an organization that provides training and then credentials certifications for it and cyber security at many different levels from the beginner level at the CompTIA ITF plus and a plus exams all the way up to the more advanced or professional level at the CompTIA security X exam which was Casp and CompTIA touches on many different assets of it cyber security I feel like is their big Market but they also go over help and fundamentals of it and Hardware with the A+ they go over networking with the network plus they go over system administration with the server plus and Linux plus CompTIA trains in a course cyber security with the Security Plus cysa pent Test Plus and security s exam and then they also touch on cloud with the cloud plus exam and of course they're always delivering new trainings and certifications stuff on like database on the data plus and the new certifications Trump CompTIA that will come out this year it's one of the biggest IT training vendors in the world the great thing about coma being vendor neutral is that it touches on the fundamentals the fundamentals for you to excel in a technology career in it and of course all the different Avenues of it it's in many languages and taking the CompTIA exam is recognized all over the world by using the Pearson view testing system so what we're saying here is that Pearson view is the company that delivers these compt exams and those are made available
G0NCHag1rKc,3,saying here is that Pearson view is the company that delivers these compt exams and those are made available to you at worldwide Pearson view test centers or at your home with the on viw testing CompTIA has a diverse training partner program which allows its ecosystem to be very robust and gives you the learner a lot of different options on how you decide to train and how you earn your Security Plus or earn your CompTIA exam or certification what I mean by that is that there is hundreds thousands of training companies out there that are CompTIA authorized training partners I don't actually know if there's thousands but it seems like it that can deliver you real CompTIA approved training in many different forms whether that be in-person training delivered by a company like us we do that trip of Technologies or university whether that's live virtual training over zoom over Microsoft teams with a real life instructor or with self-paced training like what you see on udemy and other self-paced custom Learning Management systems that are out there delivered by all this all these CompTIA approved trainers a big thing that we like to talk about in my course coming from a US Government background specifically Department of Defense is how compt is recognized in a lot of compliance for Network admins or administrators or computer administrators so I have a bolt there for DOD 8140 compliance so for all my American students because I am American so my background is in this may not apply for in the EU or anywhere else in the world so you may want to skip this but for all my student students in the US that want to work in the government specifically the dod there's something called DOD 8140 compliance that the Security Plus meets which says you are allowed to be a government worker contractor federal employee as a computer admin for the dod and other government agencies will also recognize CompTIA CTS as well so CompTIA has a great relationship in that way when it comes to compliance for working in the US Department of Defense which is what my background is so I like to
G0NCHag1rKc,4,to compliance for working in the US Department of Defense which is what my background is so I like to talk about it so why the Security Plus exam so what is the Security Plus exam it is one of the very first foundational cyber security certifications offered from CompTIA and also just widely recognized you say you have the Security Plus exam or you pass the Security Plus exam it's already given that you have some fun foundational and fundamental cyber security knowledge so Security Plus gives you foundational cyber security knowledge and it's not specifically red teaming blue teaming it's just overall knowledge it's recognized by many companies and universities some colleges will take the Security Plus in for college credits so I know in the college I went to my uh Community College I went to Security Plus counted towards like a CS not a computer science but like a cyber security 100 class many companies recognize it so like I just talked about if you're looking to jump into the dod a lot of these big DOD Contracting companies the very first search you need to get on with them is a Security Plus won't dive too deep into that this helps your of career progression so let's say you've been riding the service desk or help desk for 6 to 12 months and you want to go work at the security Operation Center you want to get into cyber security maybe within your company or externally well getting this C can prove that you're working towards your cyber security career so this can help in career progression this could also be personal learning maybe you kind of found yourself as the you you know the default it security guy sometimes that happens in these msps we work at or these small companies we work at where all of a sudden you're deploying cloud-based resources doing system administration mapping printers unlocking accounts and then you get tked with some security uh stuff as well this can also help you with your personal learning how do we pass the Security Plus so Security Plus is graded on a kind of a weird scale it's 100 to 900 and all this information is
G0NCHag1rKc,5,graded on a kind of a weird scale it's 100 to 900 and all this information is coming straight from the comp too website so if you go to the comp too website they deliver all this information about how to pass so passing is 750 the scale is900 and there will be performance-based questions I get this question a lot from my students is how are the questions rated if it's two answers out of a multiple choice so choose two is it weighted more are the performance-based questions weighted more CompTIA never releases that information it's assumed if you go on online forums which I go on Reddit and all these online performance all the time that the performance- based questions are highly weighted I don't know the accuracy of that I've seen my students in my classes report back to me saying that they didn't they just skipped those questions and they got close to an 800 I cannot tell you uh how it's graded I just know that the passing score is 750 it's on a scale of 100 to 900 according to the CompTIA website officially it's 90 minutes max the exam with with the potential of up to 90 questions now Pearson view does allow some accommodations so if it's not in your primary language uh there's a host accommodations that could give you extra time if you apply for those accommodations which I won't be covering this video but it is something you can look up so that is everything about the Security Plus exam now let's get into our training so what do I give you from trepa Technologies I'm the CEO and founder of tre Technologies an IT and cyber security training company and I have multiple different ways to deliver training to you from free to paid for to a little bit expensive with some live virtual training so I have a free and full video course on YouTube that goes over quizzes at the end of each video that covers every single topic in the security plus I have a udemy course a udemy course has quizzes that you can perform after each video that
G0NCHag1rKc,6,I have a udemy course a udemy course has quizzes that you can perform after each video that covers the exam objectives I also have a practice exam a 90 question practice exam in that udemy course as well I also have bonus videos in that course going over the comper Masters pbqs which are not the official test performance-based questions but I have videos going over those in my youing course as well and then I have what I would call our premium training which is our custombuilt learning management system that has our full practice exams over like 800 practice exam questions a dynamic test engine that you can access anywhere on the web your mobile phone using an iOS or Android app we have flashcards in there we have all of our lessons with text text and we have our full bonus catalog of videos that you may not see on that YouTube free course and a course all our trainings for the current Security Plus version Sy z-71 I'm going to quickly go through with you guys our training I'm going to pause the video show you our udemy course and then I'll pause the video again and show you our custom learning management system so this is our Security Plus course it's in a draft mode right now as of this recording February 9th this course should be released on February 15th 2025 but as you can see here we have videos let me just mute this going over every single exam objective with a quiz after each video Lesson that just you know it's a check on learning for the video you just watched I also have resources here that you can download so every single lesson has the Powerpoints that you can download here and we honestly as a company don't care what you do with this you can share it with your friends you can do whatever you want with these PowerPoints that we have created and then of course at the end we have a 90 question practice exam that I will be adding to as time goes on eventually I want to get to 600 questions so six practice
G0NCHag1rKc,7,will be adding to as time goes on eventually I want to get to 600 questions so six practice exams with 100 questions each on this course so a complete all in one bundle also missing here that will be there on the launch day is going to be 17 bonus videos going over the CompTIA performance-based questions from the official CompTIA learning so this is our udemy course now I'm going to pause the video and go over our custom learning management system so here we have our custom learning management system this is our full self-paced course that I like to say is the best way to train in this we have a Google Drive where you can go download all our course material we have a gitlab repo going over some cyber security Labs that you can try at home it's you know at home based Labs we've got all of our lessons here you can see how they're kind of we have the video we have the PowerPoint here and then we have the lessons with text and images here and then of course we have a quiz for every single lesson back at the course landing page here we also have exams that you can try we have Dynamic exams and with these Dynamic exams it's really awesome you can uh choose if you want 25 50 or 100 questions but that's our Dynamic exam exams we also have flash cards so we have flash cards that you get access to as well just to go over some of the acronyms and just to have some further training material and then of course with our custom L learning management system you get all of our bonus videos as well some other additional Labs of course all the performance- based questions um here in our lessons and I have this section off into weeks here kind of the point is it should take you six weeks if you're coming from zero to get the Security Plus exam uh to pass Security Plus exam using our training now I'm going to go back to the slide deck and finish up this video going over who we are as a company okay so
G0NCHag1rKc,8,back to the slide deck and finish up this video going over who we are as a company okay so who Am I who is the networking Guru so I'm a US Army Special Operations veteran during my time in the military it was like 2014 to 2023 I was doing it so I may have some cool photos here of me jumping out of airplanes uh which I did not enjoy Jo um but my day-to-day was working at a KN in conjunction with a sock doing day-to-day network operations and network security that was my day job in the military that's I don't have any hype stories like a lot of the brets out there in uh the you know in the veteran ecosystem I guess I'll call it I was always it first and I have a broad networking security and IT background I have 10 years of it experience I've been an instructor for the better part of like three years as my full-time job uh part-time in the military and then full-time when I got out and then of course I'm an entrepreneur I started trep of Technologies now we have just started as a company doing self-based training but for the past two years we've been doing live virtual and in-person training for the dod and major corporations like General Dynamics other companies called tripa 6 Tampa microwaves to get them certified in CompTIA and in CCNA and other exams we've done some Azure training as well a 104 so now I'm bringing all that knowledge that expertise that I have in the classroom doing in person or live virtual training and I'm bringing it to my self-paced videos and to you the student so that's who I am now enough about me let's go over how to pass the first time my best tips and tricks to pass the first time now I'm going to speak on this like you have zero it experience or very limited maybe 3 to 6 months at the help desk so that's still experience but I'm going to speak to you like you're a
G0NCHag1rKc,9,the help desk so that's still experience but I'm going to speak to you like you're a very beginner now you may say well shouldn't you take the network plus and A+ before this I would agree that if you're a complete beginner this should not be your first certification you ever triy now there's always caveats I have a buddy that works at this company he said to get SEC plus will get me on I have a buddy over here I have a parent I have a this or that those are unique and those are the exceptions not the rule I do believe you need to have foundational it knowledge to successfully learn and retain the Security Plus however to pass the exam if that's your goal to pass the exam and that's it and we're not going to get into a conversation of whether or not you should just pass the exam and move on and forget everything you learned that's something for another video I'm just going to go over how to pass the first time as a complete beginner here's my best pass first video lessons whoever that may be whether it be Professor Messer Jason Dion uh Andrew I can't never say his last name is really he's like Technical Institute of America do video training soak up as much knowledge as you can from videos learn the fundamentals so that when you get asked a practice exam question you can work through it the logic behind it you need to couple the video training if you have the time with the official reading as well that helps me to just touch on the more minor points that maybe may get skipped in video lessons after you do that for a week two weeks three weeks whatever your comfort a with maybe it's up to 6 weeks maybe you're a working professional once you go through the video training of your preferred uh vendor maybe you do some official reading I'm not going to say that as like a must but maybe you do some official reading once you go through the video training you need to start doing practice questions remember this is an exam if we were just learning
G0NCHag1rKc,10,the video training you need to start doing practice questions remember this is an exam if we were just learning cyber security this course wouldn't be called Security Plus it'd be called uh blue teaming cyber security fundamentals and the want to be a certain at the end I'd just be teaching you cyber security stuff you know day-to-day sock analyst stuff no this is a certification that we need to pass the way to pass is to do practice exams that's it and it's okay if you miss them it's okay if you're not getting 100% of the practice exams but you need to be able to work through the logic of that question have good english comprehension go through exams that teach you how to think from comp Tia's perspective there are many great vendors that offer practice exams there's Jason Dion's practice practice exams Professor master's practice exams on his website our practice exams and our mobile app and our custom running Management training or UD me course find practice exams okay go with ones that are highly rated we're new so ours won't have a lot of reviews but I think ours are the best especially our actual test engine on our custom learning management system but however you do it do practice exams and once you're getting 80 90s and you're doing it for all domains go take the test don't wait just go take that test okay now how do we take a test it's through Pearson view so you'll have to make a comp to your Pearson view account and through Pearson views website you can either test in person at a test center or online I have no opinions either way some people have horror stories of in person and online testing and some people have good experiences typically when you hear the bad stuff it's cuz they're pissed so you hear the bad stuff more often than the good things about Pearson view testing I have personally never had an issue with Pearson View in-person or online testing now I only do in-person testing I only did an online test one time uh but I have two kids and two
G0NCHag1rKc,11,do in-person testing I only did an online test one time uh but I have two kids and two dogs at the house I ain't testing at my house I like going in person sometimes there's not as much availability though so I understand if you want to do it at home now before I finish up this video I just want to go over with you some of the official CompTIA learning that's for sale on their website um they have their CMAs learn which which is just like lessons they have their Labs which is the pbqs they also have their own practice exam engine and then of course their ebook then I have our stuff here our free YouTube training or our fully paid for self-paced course on our website and from our website you can also buy vouchers in the CompTIA Labs at a discounted price as well so if you want to check out trepate tech.com um but here's all the official training and our training so that's everything that's available to you I advertise other trainer stuff here but we know the big names that are out there that can also help you pass this exam sometimes it takes more than one vendor maybe you watch Professor Messer videos you do Dion training practice questions or you just come with us get it done all in one go but anyways there's a lot of good uh trainers out there that you may have to couple with some of the CompTIA official stuff different vendors and different learning styles for different students it's all good okay so that is our video on how to pass theur plus the first time from trep of Technologies from the networking Guru I want to thank you for viewing if you're watching this on YouTube like subscribe hit that Bell if you're watching this on you to me as a promotional video go ahead add it to the cart I I I'm telling you you won't regret it we have a pretty good price and if this convince you to buy our self-paced learning I'll see that purchase come in and I'll welcome you to the trepa
G0NCHag1rKc,12,our self-paced learning I'll see that purchase come in and I'll welcome you to the trepa tech family thank you
epgQ-sAr0l8,1,this is how I would study for the Security Plus certification with just one month so if you've done any Research into beginner cyber security certifications you know that the CompTIA Security Plus is the most popular and employer sought after certification for beginners looking to start a career in cyber security you'll find the Security Plus on almost all beginner and entry-level cyber security job listings which is why even with all of the new certifications that are coming out people are still looking to study for their compa Security Plus because it just so happens to be the one that hiring managers and recruiters looking for now I actually passed my Security Plus in my early career when I was just about a year into my first job in cyber security I was studying for it part-time along with my full-time job but this video is going to be for those of you who want to study and pass your Security Plus as quickly as you can especially going into the next hiring season for 2025 if you get your Security Plus on your resume it's really going to help boost you a lot especially since nowadays it's such a common requirement for job applications that if you don't have it then that already hurts your chances of getting a call back and of course nowadays you just have way more study resources and you have ai studying tools and different technologies that you can use one of which is the iFly Tech AI notes Air 2 which I'll also be talking about later in this video okay so here is how I would study for the Security Plus with just one month using all the resources and AI tools at your disposal first let's talk about my top recommended study resources there's going to be four things that you need on this list number one is Professor mess study notes and comts Security Plus videos I know a lot of people who have primarily used Professor M's study resources to pass their CompTIA exams and he has resources on the A+ Security Plus network plus you name it and most of his study resources are completely free so I would highly recommend it taking
epgQ-sAr0l8,2,plus you name it and most of his study resources are completely free so I would highly recommend it taking advantage of that watching the entire Professor Master compt Security Plus study guide videos and use that as your first pass for all the material on the Security Plus exam number two this one is a bit more optional and that is the compy of all-in-one textbook personally when I'm studying I like multiple mediums video physical textbook online resources and practice exams so we're basically going to cover the gamut not everyone is going to want to study out of a textbook but I personally use the comp all inone textbook I rented it on Amazon when I was studying it's a pretty hefty textbook it's 600 plus pages and I read that from cover to cover but I was able to pass my Security Plus on the first try and that is not something that everyone can say and one of the big reasons I think is because of a textbook it's just very different reading something on paper compared to just skiing through it online sometimes it can feel like it sticks in your head more when you have the physical textbook in front of you but again it's not for everyone and and if you only have one month to study it then you're primarily going to be using the chapter summaries and the appendix at the end of the book so that is one of the big reasons why I think the textbook is an optional piece unless you really have the time to dedicate to reading through it and then finally the last resources are the compa Security Plus official exam objectives guide and good old AI learning tools so basically choosing the AI learning tool of your choice going on there using the CompTIA exam objectives guide and having them make you a personalized study plan for the next 4 weeks you can even tell them which areas you want to focus more on for example if you're not as familiar with network security or network protocols that you can have it create a study plan catered towards your needs and your specific learning areas that you need more help on and when I
epgQ-sAr0l8,3,plan catered towards your needs and your specific learning areas that you need more help on and when I was studying for my security plus we did not have all these AI tools so I would highly recommend it taking advantage of them to basically 2X or even 10x your study time and if you're looking for a study tool that can help you take quality notes while keeping you organized I'd recommend checking out the iFly Tech AI note Air 2 thank you to iFly tech for sponsoring this portion of the video this is currently my favorite notetaking tool because of the paper light screen and writing experience it feels like I'm writing in a notebook but it's much more portable and convenient to use and it has a built-in AI generated summary for audio transcribed notes using your chat GPT account and everything is securely synced to the cloud the realtime voice to text feature is perfect for not taking while you're watching study material for the Security Plus or any other certification or course all on on a 8.2 in e in display and if you like you can convert your handwriting to typed text so your notes are easily reviewable the next time you go through them you can also use iFly Tech doc scan to quickly scan paper documents or notes for digital access and even take notes directly on PDFs there's also a schedule management tool which I've been using as my personal daily schedule where you can automatically create TOS with your audio or handwritten notes when you Circle or store content using the pens side button then you can automatically highlight attention items to manage your schedule the feature can be activated in the settings you can also view your weekly work report which is a perfect way to track your progress the iFly Tech AI note Air 2 is the perfect study tool for certifications or anything else that you're currently studying for and something really cool about this tool is that it can also perform Real World multilanguage Translation with their voice to text feature which can be used for work meetings or any scenarios where
epgQ-sAr0l8,4,Translation with their voice to text feature which can be used for work meetings or any scenarios where you're actively taking notes even internationally which can happen more often than you think while working in cber security right now iFly Tech is having a huge discount and you can check out the iFly Tech AI note Air 2 through the link in my description and now let's get back to the rest of the video all right guys so here is the full study timeline that I would recommend starting with a high level week one is a full Security Plus exam objectives guide walkth through week two review all key Concepts in the compt Security Plus all-in-one textbook and don't forget to take notes and complete all of the chapter summary questions week number three complete Professor messer's entire CompTIA Security Plus course again this is free on Professor messer's YouTube channel and his website so feel free to use whichever resource you prefer but remember these four weeks are going to be eat sleep breathe Security Plus so you really need to log into the schedule and and take this seriously because you don't want to pay another exam fee if you don't pass the first time around and if you're following this guide and this timeline then your chances of passing are already very very high so as gen Z and gen alas a you have to lock in if you want to pass your Security Plus exam on the first drive you have to take this seriously and basically study hundreds of cybercity Concepts into 4 weeks which is definitely possible but again it's going to take a lot of work don't think that this is going to be an easy exam that you can just get under your belt after just nonchalantly studying and and not doing it with your full dedication setting for your Security Plus especially if you're a beginner with no previous experience it's going to need your full attention starting in week one which is when we cover the complete exam objectives and what this is it's basically a document created by CompTIA that will give you the full vocabulary list
epgQ-sAr0l8,5,this is it's basically a document created by CompTIA that will give you the full vocabulary list of all the exam topics all the protocols all the concepts that are on the Security Plus exam and basically all outlined in one PDF document I basically use this as a sanity checklist the first week going through this you can also cross reference through the Security Plus all-in-one textbook and this exam objectives guide because both of them will have all the concepts on the exam but just in different formats your job is to get as familiar as you can with all the topics on the exam objectives list and then week two is going to be we're diving head first into the All In textbook I highly recommend it taking a lot of good notes because you're also going to refer back to them when you're doing your practice exams and practice questions most Security Plus textbooks will also have a practice exam question or summary at the end of each chapter there's usually about 15 to 20 Questions per chapter I would always do those when I was studying for my Security Plus I also went back and re-reviewed all of the practice questions and answers before I took the official exam that's how helpful they were so definitely don't sleep on those do them again week two I don't expect everyone to be reading a textbook full on in just one week but you should at least be doing those practice questions reading through the chapter summaries going through the appendex and reading through the specific areas of the concepts and topics that you're not as comfortable with maybe you don't know anything about cryptography maybe you're not as familiar with digital forensics maybe you're not as familiar with the types of vulnerabilities and exploits then read those chapters you can jump around the textbook you don't have to read the chapter that you're already familiar with or already learned in the past in another course or any other resources we two is really about filling in the gaps for the areas that you have the most trouble with so when you see it on an exam it won't catch you off
epgQ-sAr0l8,6,you have the most trouble with so when you see it on an exam it won't catch you off guard another thing to note is that you should not be relying on memorizing acronyms for example I had someone in our Discord Channel tell me that they took their Security Plus exam but because the practice exam that they did had all the acronyms in the questions and answers spelled out for them so they didn't know that they had to actually memorize acronyms this is one of the most important things to keep in mind not everything is going to be completely spelled out in the actual exam no matter what practice questions that you do no matter what AI tool that you get to generate you practice questions you need to make sure that you're using practice questions and practice exams from multiple different sources and not just relying on one format because you can easily get screwed over by that like this person did so don't just remember the acronym also remember what the acronym stands for and what it means week number three this one should be an easier one you're basically solidifying all the information that you first learn through reading the exam objectives guide and the CompTIA Security Plus textbook and now you will be focusing on Professor mess's Security Plus course this course is video based so you don't have any more reading to do at least not as much but you're primarily going to be soaking in that information and tying it back to what you've already learned you're basically Making Connections every time you study from a new source or a new format it's going to remind you of info that you've already learned it might show you areas that you might have missed this is why I plan out the study guide this way because you're basically studying from beginning to end in week one and you're studying from beginning to end in week two and then finally one last time in week three from beginning to end of the CompTIA Security Plus material because let's face it you're basically cramming months of study material into four weeks but if
epgQ-sAr0l8,7,material because let's face it you're basically cramming months of study material into four weeks but if that's what it takes to get the Security Plus onto your resume before next year's hiring Cycles then it's going to be well worth it and finally in week number four you're going to be focusing all in on practice exams practice questions I probably did almost a thousand or more practice questions and I did at least two full-on practice exams so I treated these as real exams I timed myself obviously it was a practice exam so I was still able to review my answers and see what I got wrong but every time I answer a practice question set and I get a question wrong I always go back and try to figure out why what the correct answer was and really trying to knock it into my head to remember for next time I see something similar potentially in the real exam so when you get something wrong that is always something to keep in mind and write down so you can restudy it at least a few days before the official exam now I have a lot of exam resources I can share Linked In My description including Josh maor's Security Plus practice questions he has a really huge set of practice questions that you can use along with all the other study resources I mentioned in this video the Security Plus is a lot to study for but trust me it is going to be worth it when you finally get certified this was my first official professional certification that I've ever gotten in my career so personally I do think that it's very well worth it and it also helped me get my second job in cyber security so it is very very well worth it to have this on your resume all right that's it for this video don't forget to check out the iFly te AI note Air 2 and get their product launch discount through the link in my description thank you guys so much for watching if you have any questions feel free to drop them in the comments below don't forget to also stay connected on LinkedIn and on our Discord Channel

3EgYr7jR4NI,1,"DION: Hello, and welcome to the course. I am Dion, a program manager at Google. I've worked in security for the past five years in areas ranging from risk management to insider threat detection. I'll be your first instructor in this course. As a security analyst, you will help protect the assets of the organization you work for, including tangible or physical assets, such as software and network devices, as well as intangible assets like PII, copyrights, and intellectual property. Imagine if this kind of sensitive information were to be exposed by a threat actor. It would be devastating to the reputation and financial stability of the organization and the people the organization serves. In previous courses, we discussed a variety of topics that are relevant to the security profession, including core security concepts, frameworks and controls, threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, networks, incident detection and response, and programming basics. Now it's time to put all of these core security concepts to practical use. In this course, we'll further explore how to protect assets and communicate incidents. Then we'll discuss when and how to escalate incidents to protect an organization's assets and data. We'll also cover how to communicate effectively to influence stakeholders' decisions related to security. After that, Emily, your instructor for the second part of this course, will introduce some reliable resources that will help you engage with the security community after you complete the certificate program. And finally, we'll cover how to find, prepare for, and apply for security jobs. This will include discussions about how to create a compelling resume and tips to help you throughout the interview process. When I started my first security-based role, I was excited to be hired at Google to protect information and devices. I was also happy to be"
3EgYr7jR4NI,2,"Google to protect information and devices. I was also happy to be a part of a broader team that I could learn from and reach out to for support. My team helped me grow my expertise, and I'm proud of my contribution to our projects. By the end of this course, you'll have had multiple opportunities to refine your understanding of key security concepts, create a resume, build confidence in your interview skills, and even participate in an Artificial Intelligence or AI-generated interview. The security profession is such an amazing field, and I'm looking forward to you joining it. I have one question for you. Are you ready to get started? Welcome to the first section of the course. In the next several videos, we'll discuss what it means to have a security mindset and how you'll use that mindset to protect an organization's assets and data. Then we'll explore the process of incident escalation in the event of a breach. Finally, we'll share information to better help you understand the sensitive nature of the data that you'll work to protect. Coming up, we'll focus on how to develop a security mindset, then use that mindset to protect organizations and the people they serve. Let's take a little time to discuss a concept that will help you throughout your security career, having a security mindset. In previous courses, we discussed various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities and how they can impact organizational operations and the people served by those organizations. These concepts are key considerations when thinking about having a security mindset. You'll have to recognize not only what you're defending but what or who you're defending against. For example, it's important to recognize the types of assets that are essential to maintaining an organization's business functions along with types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that can"
3EgYr7jR4NI,3,"with types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that can negatively impact those assets. And that's what having a security mindset is all about. A security mindset is the ability to evaluate risk and constantly seek out and identify the potential or actual breach of a system, application, or data. Earlier in the program, we discussed threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that are posed by social engineering attacks, such as phishing. These attacks are designed to compromise an organization's assets to help the threat actor or actors gain access to sensitive information. Using our security mindset can help prevent these types of attacks. It's important that we're constantly staying up to date with the kinds of attacks that are happening. To do this, it's good to develop a habit of seeking out information regarding the latest security trends or vulnerabilities. As you do this, new ideas for protecting company data may come to mind. Security is an everyday objective for every security team in the industry. So having a security mindset helps analysts defend against the constant pressure from attackers. That mindset can make you think every click of the mouse has the potential to lead to a security breach. That level of scrutiny as a security professional helps you prepare for the worst-case scenario, even if it doesn't happen. Entry-level analysts can help protect low level assets, such as an organization's guest Wi-Fi network, and high importance assets, such as intellectual property, trade secrets, PII, and even financial information. Your security mindset allows you to protect all levels of assets. However, if an incident does occur, that doesn't mean you respond to all incidents in the same way. So we'll discuss incident prioritization a little later in the course. Having a strong security mindset can help set you apart from other candidates as you prepare to enter"
3EgYr7jR4NI,4,"mindset can help set you apart from other candidates as you prepare to enter the security profession. It may even be a good idea to reference that foundation in future job interviews. We'll discuss interview preparation in detail later in the course. Coming up, we'll focus on incident detection in greater detail. Welcome back. In earlier courses, we discussed the impact that security incidents can have on the critical data and assets of an organization. If data and assets are compromised, it can lead to financial pains for an organization. It can even lead to regulatory fines and the loss of credibility with customers or other businesses in the same industry. This is why your role in protecting company data and assets is so valuable. Collaboration is an exciting part about working in security. There are so many individuals across an organization that are interested in various functions of security. No security professional can do this alone. Some team members are focused on protecting sensitive financial data. Others work on protecting usernames and passwords. Some are more focused on protecting third-party vendor security. And others may be concerned with protecting employees' PII. These stakeholders and others have an interest in the role the security team plays for keeping the organization and the people it serves safe from malicious attacks. It's important to recognize that the assets and data you protect affect multiple levels of your organization. One of the most important concerns for an organization is the protection of customer data. Customers trust that an organization they engage with will protect their data at all times. This means credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, emails, usernames, passwords, and so much more. It's important to keep this in mind when taking on a security role. Understanding the importance of the data you're protecting is a big part of having a"
3EgYr7jR4NI,5,"of the data you're protecting is a big part of having a strong security mindset. As a security professional, it's important to handle sensitive data with care while being mindful of the little details to ensure that private data is protected from breaches. When a security event results in a data breach, it is categorized as a security incident. However, if the event is resolved without resulting in a breach, it's not considered an incident. It's better to be safe when it comes to taking a job in the security profession. That means paying attention to details and raising your issues to your supervisor. For example, a seemingly small issue like an employee installing an app on their work device without getting permission from the help desk should be escalated to a supervisor. This is because some apps have vulnerabilities that can pose a threat to the security of the organization. An example of a bigger issue is noticing that a log may have malicious code executed in it. Malicious code can lead to operational downtime, severe financial consequences, or the loss of critical high-level assets. The point is that there are no issues that are too small or too big. If you're not sure of the potential impact of an incident, it's always best to be cautious and report events to the appropriate team members. Each day on the job as a security professional comes with a level of responsibility to help protect the organization and the people it serves. The decisions you make not only affect the company but also its customers and countless team members across the organization. Remember, what you do matters. You've had an opportunity to learn more about the important role an entry level analyst plays in protecting the data and assets of an organization. Let's quickly review what we covered. We started off by discussing the importance of having a security"
3EgYr7jR4NI,6,"what we covered. We started off by discussing the importance of having a security mindset, including how it supports incident detection. Then we examined the relationship between incidents and events and further explored the incident escalation process. We ended our discussion by exploring the sensitive nature of the data that you're protecting and the amount of people counting on you to play your part in protecting that data. Understanding how valuable you are as a member of the security team can help you put the work you do into perspective. Every role in security matters. Each individual contributes to making a company's operations flow smoothly. I hope you enjoyed our discussion as much as I did. Are you ready to continue your journey into the security world? Coming up, we'll discuss the importance of escalating security incidents. I'm excited that you could join me today. Previously, you learned about the importance of various asset types. You also learned about the relationship between incidents and events. Now we'll focus on escalating those incidents and events to the right people. Protecting the data and assets of an organization is the primary goal of a security team. The decisions you make everyday are important for helping the security team achieve that goal. Recognizing when and how to escalate security incidents is crucial. It helps ensure simple issues don't become larger problems for an organization. Escalation is a term you should familiarize yourself with. It's likely to resurface often as you continue your journey into the security profession. In the following videos, we'll discuss incident escalation from an entry-level analyst perspective. Then we'll explore various incident classification types and the impact security incidents can have on business operations. Finally, we'll share some general guidelines for escalating incidents. Coming up, we'll start by focusing on incident escalation and how it can be used to"
3EgYr7jR4NI,7,"focusing on incident escalation and how it can be used to prevent a seemingly small issue from becoming a bigger problem. Let's get started. Security analysts are hired to protect company assets and data, including knowing when and how to escalate security incidents. In this video, we'll define security incident escalation and discuss your role in making decisions that help protect your organization's data and assets. So what is incident escalation? And why is it so important for security professionals? Incident escalation is a process of identifying a potential security incident, triaging it, and, if appropriate, handing it off to a more experienced team member. It's important to also recognize that not every incident needs to be escalated. In this video, we'll cover what types of incidents should be escalated. As an entry-level analyst, it's unlikely that you'll be responding to security incidents independently. However, it's important that how to evaluate and escalate incidents to the right individual or team when necessary. Let's discuss the essential skills needed to properly escalate security incidents. There are two essential skills that will help you identify security incidents that need to be escalated, attention to detail and an ability to follow an organization's escalation guidelines or processes. Attention to detail will help you quickly identify when something doesn't seem right within the organization's network or systems. Following your company's escalation guidelines or processes will help you know how to properly escalate the issue you've identified. Larger organization security teams have many levels, and each level or member of that team plays a major role in protecting the company's assets and data. However, smaller and medium-size companies have only one or two people responsible for the organization's security. For now, we'll focus on the roles in bigger organizations. From the Chief Information Security Officer, also known as the CISO,"
3EgYr7jR4NI,8,"Security Officer, also known as the CISO, to the engineering team, public relations team, and even the legal team, every member of the security team matters. Each team member's role depends on the nature and scope of the incident. These roles are highlighted within a company's escalation process. Even the smallest security incident can become a much larger issue if not addressed. And that's where you come in. Imagine you're working at your desk and notice what appears to be a minor incident, but you decide to take a break before addressing or escalating it. This decision could have major consequences. If a small issue goes unescalated for too long, it has the potential to become a larger problem that costs the company money, exposes sensitive customer data, or damages the company's reputation. However, with a high level of attention to detail and an ability to follow your organization's escalation guidelines and processes, it may be possible to avoid exposing the business and its customers to harmful incidents. As an entry-level analyst, you play an important role. You help the security team identify issues within the network and systems and help make sure the right person on the team is alerted when incidents occur. Think about an assembly line. Would the final step in the line be negatively impacted if the first step were done incorrectly or not at all? Of course it would. Every decision you make helps the entire security team protect an organization's assets and data. Knowing when and how to escalate security incidents is one of many important decisions you'll need to make on a daily basis. Later in this course, we'll discuss the various levels of security incidents. Knowing those levels will help you determine the level of urgency needed to escalate different incident types. Previously, we defined what it"
3EgYr7jR4NI,9,"to escalate different incident types. Previously, we defined what it means to escalate an incident. We also discussed the skills needed to properly escalate incidents when the time comes. In this video, we're going to cover a few incident classification types to be aware of-- malware infection, unauthorized access, and improper usage. A malware infection is the incident type that occurs when malicious software designed to disrupt a system infiltrates an organization's computers or network. As discussed in a previous course, malware infections can come in many forms. Some are simple, and others are a bit more complex. One example is a phishing attempt. These are relatively simple malware infections. Another example is a ransomware attack, which is considered much more complex. Malware infections can cause a system's network to run at unusually low speeds. Attackers can even prevent an organization from viewing critical data unless the organization pays the attacker ransom to unlock the data. This incident type is especially impactful to an organization because of the amount of sensitive data stored on an organization's network and computers. Escalating malware infections is an important aspect of protecting the organization that you work for. But wait. There's more. The second incident type we'll discuss is unauthorized access. This is an incident type that occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or application without permission. As you may recall, earlier in the program, we discussed brute force attacks, which use trial and error to compromise passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. These attacks are often used to help attackers gain unauthorized access to organization systems or applications. All unauthorized access incidents are important to escalate. However, the urgency of that escalation depends on how critical that system is to the organization's business operations. We'll explore this idea in more"
3EgYr7jR4NI,10,"system is to the organization's business operations. We'll explore this idea in more detail later in this course. The third incident we'll discuss is improper usage. This is an incident type that occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization's acceptable use policies. This one can be a bit complicated. There are instances when improper usage is unintentional. For example, an employee may attempt to access software licenses for personal use or even use a company's system to access a friend's or co-worker's data. Maybe the employee wasn't aware of the policy they were violating. Or maybe the policy wasn't properly defined and communicated to employees. But there are other times where improper usage is an intentional act. So how do you know if an improper usage incident is accidental or intentional? That can be a difficult decision to make. That's why improper usage incidents should always be escalated to a supervisor. As a member of an organization's security team, it's likely that you'll encounter a variety of incident types while on the job. So it's important to know what they are and how to escalate them. So far, we've discussed different incident types and the importance of escalating those incidents to the right person. But what happens if an incident goes unescalated for too long? In this video, we'll discuss the potential impact that even the smallest incident can have on an organization if it goes unnoticed. Are you ready? Great. Now let's take a journey into the life of an organization's security team. It's been a quiet day for the security team. Suddenly, you notice there's been unusual log activity in an app that was recently banned from the organization. You make a note to mention this activity during the next meeting with your supervisor. But you forget and"
3EgYr7jR4NI,11,"mention this activity during the next meeting with your supervisor. But you forget and never mention it. Following this same scenario, let's fast forward to a week later. You and your supervisor are meeting again. But now the supervisor indicates that a data breach has occurred. This breach has impacted one of the manufacturing sites for the organization. Now all operations at the manufacturing site have been put on hold. This causes the company to lose money and precious time. Days later, the security team discovers that the data breach began with suspicious activity in the app that was recently banned from the organization. What we've learned from this scenario is that a simple incident can lead to a much larger issue if not escalated properly. Incident criticality is also important to note here. Initially, an incident can be escalated with a medium level of criticality if the analyst doesn't have enough information to determine the amount of damage done to the organization. Once an experienced incident handler reviews the incident, the incident may be increased or decreased to a high or low criticality level. Every security incident you encounter is important to an organization, but some incidents are certainly more urgent than others. So what's the best way to determine the urgency of a security incident? It really depends on the asset or assets that the incident affects. For example, if an employee forgets their login password for their work computer, a low-level security incident may be prompted if they have repeated failed login attempts. This incident needs to be addressed, but the impact of this incident is likely minimal. In other instances, assets are critical to an organization's business operations, such as a manufacturing plant or database that stores PII. These types of assets need to be protected with a high level of urgency. The impact of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a manufacturing"
3EgYr7jR4NI,12,"gaining unauthorized access to a manufacturing application or PII is far greater than a forgotten password because the attacker could interfere with the manufacturing processes or expose private customer data. I hope this video has helped you understand the importance of knowing the relationship between assets and security incidents. Later in this course, we'll share some new concepts related to escalation timing and why your role in that process matters. We've shared quite a bit about the importance of your role when it comes to escalating incidents. We've even discussed a few incident types that you may encounter. But what are the actual steps you need to take to properly escalate that incident? The answer to that question actually depends on the organization you're working for. There is no set standard or process for incident escalation that all organizations use. Every security team has their own processes and procedures when it comes to handling incidents. In this video, we're going to discuss general guidelines for incident escalation and how to apply them on the job. Let's get started. Each organization has its own process for handling security incidents. That process is known as an escalation policy, which is a set of actions that outline who should be notified when an incident alert occurs and how that incident should be handled. Ideally, the escalation process would go smoothly every time. But in a workplace, challenges to that process can happen unexpectedly. For example, what if your immediate supervisor is out of office? If an incident occurs that day, it still needs to be escalated to someone. This is one example of why understanding your organization's escalation policy is important. You don't need to memorize your organization's escalation policy, but it is wise to save or bookmark it on your work device. This way, you'll always have access to it when you need it. Following an organization's"
3EgYr7jR4NI,13,"access to it when you need it. Following an organization's escalation policy is essential because the actions you take help protect the organization and the people it serves from malicious actors. The escalation policy for an organization can be an extensive document. So it's up to you to pay attention to the small details within the escalation policy of your organization. Attention to detail can make the difference between escalating an incident to the right or wrong person. It can also help you prioritize which incidents need to be escalated with more or less urgency. Every organization handles incident escalation differently. But analysts need to ensure that incidents are handled correctly. Great work expanding your security mindset. Now you've had an opportunity to learn about the essential role you'll be playing by escalating incidents. Let's review what we've covered in this section of the course. We started off by defining incident escalation and discussing useful traits needed to properly escalate incidents. We also explored a few incident classification types and their potential impacts on organization. From there, we discussed how small security incidents can become bigger problems if not properly addressed. Finally, we covered some general guidelines for the actual process of incident escalation. This process varies depending on the organization you work for. But one thing should always remain the same, your attention to detail. Understanding how each incident affects the data and assets of an organization is really important because the decisions you make can affect the entire security team and organization. Are you ready to continue your security journey? Coming up, we'll discuss stakeholders and how to communicate effectively with them. We've covered so much in previous courses, from the foundations of security to a basic understanding of networks, and programming languages like SQL and Python. These concepts are core knowledge when preparing for a role in the security profession. But how does this information"
3EgYr7jR4NI,14,"are core knowledge when preparing for a role in the security profession. But how does this information help you on a day-to-day basis? And to whom do you communicate this information? In this course, we'll start by discussing who stakeholders are. Then we'll identify their roles in relation to security. Finally, we'll share effective communication strategies for relaying key information to stakeholders. But before we can communicate with stakeholders, we have to understand who they are and why they are important. So let's get started. Let's discuss the hierarchy within an organization. It goes from you, the analyst, to management, all the way up to executives. Hierarchy is a great way to understand stakeholders. A stakeholder is defined as an individual or group that has an interest in the decisions or activities of an organization. This is important for your role as an entry-level analyst because the decisions made on a day-to-day basis by stakeholders will impact how you do your job. Let's focus on stakeholders who have an interest in the daily choices analysts make. After all, you may be asked to communicate your findings to them. So let's learn a little bit more about who they are and the roles they play in regards to security. Security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities can affect an entire company's operations. From financial implications to the loss of customer data and trust, the impact of security incidents are limitless. Each stakeholder has a responsibility to provide inputs on the various decisions and activities of the security team and how to best protect the organization. There are many stakeholders that pay close attention to the security of critical organizational assets and data. We're going to focus on five of those stakeholders-- risk managers; the Chief Executive Officer, also known as a CEO; the Chief Financial"
3EgYr7jR4NI,15,"Executive Officer, also known as a CEO; the Chief Financial Officer, also known as a CFO; the Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO; and operations managers. Let's discuss each of these stakeholders in more detail. Risk managers are important to an organization because they help identify risks and manage the response to security incidents. They also notify the legal department regarding regulatory issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, risk managers inform the organization's public relations team in case there is a need to publish public communications regarding an incident. Next is the Chief Executive Officer, also known as a CEO. This is the highest ranking person in an organization. CEOs are responsible for financial and managerial decisions. They also have an obligation to report to shareholders and manage the operations of a company. So naturally, security is a top priority for the CEO. Now let's discuss the Chief Financial Officer, known as a CFO. CFOs are senior executives responsible for managing the financial operations of a company. They are concerned about security from a financial standpoint because of the potential cost of an incident to the business. They are also interested in the costs associated with tools and strategies that are necessary to combat security incidents. Another stakeholder with an interest in security is the Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO. CISOs are high-level executives responsible for developing an organization's security architecture and conducting risk analysis and system audits. They're also tasked with creating security and business continuity plans. Last, we have operations managers. Operations managers oversee security professionals to help identify and safeguard an organization from security threats. These individuals often work directly with analysts as the first line of defense when it comes to protecting the company from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. They are also generally responsible for the daily maintenance"
3EgYr7jR4NI,16,"generally responsible for the daily maintenance of security operations. As an entry-level analyst at a large organization, it's unlikely that you'll communicate directly with the risk manager, CEO, CFO, or the CISO. However, the operations manager will likely ask you to create communications to share with those individuals. Coming up, we'll focus a bit more on stakeholders and how to effectively communicate with them. Welcome back. Previously, we discussed stakeholders and the important security roles they play within an organization. Now let's explore the role you play in communicating with those stakeholders. The information that's communicated to stakeholders is sensitive. For example, if you send an email to stakeholders about a recent security breach, it's important to be mindful of what you communicate and who you communicate to. Different stakeholders may need to be informed about different issues. As a result, your communications with them need to be clear, concise, and focused. Security is a detail-driven profession, so it's essential that you stay mindful of the details when sending your communications. Stakeholders are very busy people. Your communication should be precise, avoid unnecessary technical terms, and have a clear purpose. You don't want them to have to guess the reason for your email or why it matters to them. To help with this, ask your manager or immediate supervisors questions to find out what the stakeholders you communicate with need to know. As you may recall, earlier, we discussed what it means to have a security mindset. A part of that mindset means asking questions about the assets and data you're protecting. For example, you could ask, what's the most important data to protect on a daily basis? Or what security tool has been most important or useful to protect our data and assets? Having a security mindset"
3EgYr7jR4NI,17,"has been most important or useful to protect our data and assets? Having a security mindset also means understanding what matters most to stakeholders so you know what information to share with them. Effective communication involves relaying only the information that is most relevant to stakeholders. Staying informed about security issues helps stakeholders do their jobs more effectively. Your role in communicating with stakeholders is to help them obtain that information. This is yet another example of how essential your role is within a security team. Coming up, we'll discuss the information that is most important to communicate with stakeholders. Previously, we discussed communicating information that is important to stakeholders. It's essential that communications are specific and clear so stakeholders understand what's happening and what actions may need to be taken. In this video, we'll go into more detail about how to create precise and clear communications. Creating security communications to share with stakeholders is similar to telling a great story. Stories typically have a beginning, middle, and end. Somewhere in that story, there is some sort of conflict and an eventual resolution. This concept is also true when telling security stories to stakeholders. The security story details what the security challenge is, how it impacts the organization, and possible solutions to the issue. The security story also includes data related to the challenge, its impact, and proposed solutions. This data could be in the form of reports that summarize key findings or a list of issues that may need immediate attention. Let's use the following scenario as an example. You've been monitoring system logs and notice possible malicious code execution in the logs that could lead to the exposure of sensitive user information. Now you need to communicate what is happening to a stakeholder, in this case, your immediate supervisor. The first step is to"
3EgYr7jR4NI,18,"immediate supervisor. The first step is to detail the issue-- potential malicious code execution found while monitoring the logs. The next step is to refer to the organization's incident response playbook and mention the suggested guidance from the playbook regarding malicious code found in system logs. This shows your supervisor that you've been paying attention to the procedures already established by the team. The final piece of your story is to provide a possible solution to the issue. In this scenario, you may not be the final decision-maker regarding what action is taken. But you've explained to the stakeholder what has happened and a possible solution to the problem. You can communicate the story we just discussed in various ways. Send an email, share a document, or even communicate through the use of a visual representation. You can also use incident management or ticketing systems. Many organizations have incident management or ticketing systems that follow the steps outlined in their security playbooks. Some scenarios are better expressed by using visual elements. Visuals are used to convey key details in the form of graphs, charts, videos, or other visual effects. This allows stakeholders to view a pictorial representation of what is being explained. Visual dashboards can help you tell a full security story to stakeholders. Later in this course, you'll have an opportunity to learn how to use Google Sheets to create a visual security story. That's going to be fun. A security professional who knows how to tell a compelling and concise security story can help stakeholders make decisions about the best ways to respond to an incident. Ideally, you want to be someone that makes stakeholders' jobs easier, and communicating effectively will certainly help you do that. Coming up, we'll continue our discussion about communicating with stakeholders. The ability to communicate threats, risks, vulnerabilities, or incidents,"
3EgYr7jR4NI,19,"with stakeholders. The ability to communicate threats, risks, vulnerabilities, or incidents, and possible solutions is a valuable skill for security professionals. In this video, we'll focus on various communication strategies that can help you engage with and convey key ideas to stakeholders. Let's start with visuals. The use of visuals to tell a security story can help you communicate impactful data and metrics. Charts and graphs are particularly helpful for this. They can be used to compare data points or show small parts of a larger issue. Using relevant and detailed graphics can help you develop the story you want to tell stakeholders so they can make decisions that will help protect the organization. While visuals are a compelling way to capture the attention of your stakeholders, some issues are best explained in an email or even a phone call. Be mindful of the sensitive information contained in these types of communications. For security purposes, it's important to communicate sensitive information with care. Be sure to follow the procedures outlined in your organization's playbooks, and always make sure to send emails to the right email recipient as it could create a risk if the wrong person receives confidential security information. One challenging thing about emails is the potentially long wait time for a response. Stakeholders have many responsibilities. This means they may sometimes miss an email or fail to respond in a timely manner. In these instances, a simple phone call or instant message may be a better option. My experience in security has taught me that sometimes a simple instant message or a call can help move a situation forward. Direct communication is often better than waiting days or weeks for an email response to an issue that requires immediate attention. When appropriate, take the initiative to follow-up with a stakeholder if they haven't responded to an email in a timely manner. It sounds simple,"
3EgYr7jR4NI,20,"if they haven't responded to an email in a timely manner. It sounds simple, but a friendly call can often prevent a major issue from occurring. It's important to stand out in the security profession, especially if you don't have previous experience in the industry. Visual representations, emails, and phone calls are great ways to showcase your written and verbal communication skills. The visual aspect shows your ability to put metrics and data together in an impactful way. If you don't receive a timely response from a stakeholder, following up shows initiative. In this video, we're going to have a bit of fun. We'll create a visual security story. Here's the scenario. The operations manager, one of the stakeholders we previously discussed, has been informed that the chief information security officer, also known as the CISO, wants to know how many employees are often clicking on phishing emails. The goal is to identify which five departments click on those emails most often. An investigation reveals that the five departments that most frequently click on phishing emails are human resources, customer service, global security, media relations, and professional development. Based on this information, the security team can create a visual representation of the data to share with the operations manager and the CISO. Those stakeholders and the security team can then work together to determine how to address the issue. There are many different platforms available that can be used to create and share visual stories of data. Apache OpenOffice is a free open-source office suite that allows users to create spreadsheets and other visual representations. Another new course option is Google Sheets. Today, we'll enter our data into Google Sheets. Then we'll create a bar chart visualization to develop the data story. If you don't have"
3EgYr7jR4NI,21,"bar chart visualization to develop the data story. If you don't have a Google account, you'll need to create one. Let's start by demonstrating how to create an account. First, go to google.com, and click on Sign In. Click Create Account and select For My Personal Use. Then complete each step to create your personal account. Now that you've created your Google account, it's time for us to begin creating our Google Sheets bar chart visualization. Click the Dots menu in the top-right corner. Click the Sheets icon. Click Blank to start a new spreadsheet. Select cell A1. Type Department. Select cell B1. Type # of clicked phishing emails. Select cell A2. Type Human Resources. Select cell B2. Type 30.

3EgYr7jR4NI,22,"allows security team members to convey essential information to stakeholders so issues can be communicated in a meaningful and understandable way. These data stories can also help promote a better understanding of issues that exist within an organization and allow decision-makers to determine how to address security issues that put the organization at risk. You've had an opportunity to learn about the important role stakeholders play and different ways to communicate with them. Let's review what we covered. We started by defining stakeholders and their roles in protecting an organization. We also explored the sensitive nature of communications with stakeholders and the importance of sharing that information with care and confidentiality. Then we discussed information that needs to be communicated to stakeholders. After all, stakeholders are extremely busy, so we only want to share relevant information that they need to be aware of. We ended our discussion by introducing various communication strategies, including emails, phone calls, and visual dashboards. Understanding who the stakeholders are within your organization and how to communicate with them will help you throughout your career as a security professional. Be intentional about the strategies you use to communicate. Remove unnecessary details from your communications, and be specific and precise when relaying information to stakeholders. Stakeholders are depending on you as a storyteller to tell them the security story or the potential issues and solutions in a way that makes sense. The communication strategies we discussed will help you stand out as someone who has a combination of technical and transferable skills. Coming up, your instructor for the final sections of this course, Emily, will discuss a few ways to engage with the security community and how to find and apply for jobs in the security field.

My team works closely with our remarkable security experts to craft innovative and engaging educational solutions for our workforce to keep security at the forefront. I'll be your instructor for the remainder of the course to discuss important career-related topics, such as how to engage with the security community, find jobs in the security field, create a resume, and navigate the interview process. We're approaching the end of the certificate program. What an incredible journey it's been so far. We've discussed a lot up to this point, including incident detection and escalation and the roles that stakeholders play in protecting an organization. We've also explored the sensitive nature of the communications we share and strategies for conveying critical information to stakeholders. But does the learning stop now that we're approaching the end of the program? Absolutely not. In the following videos, we'll identify reliable security resources you can use to stay up to date on security news and trends. Then we'll share some ways to become involved with the security community. We'll end with a discussion about how to establish and advance a career in security. Coming up, we'll highlight some great resources to help you stay current on what's happening in the security industry. As we approach the end of our program, it's important to start thinking about ways to engage with the security community. As the industry evolves, it's essential to stay up to date on the latest security trends and news. Let's discuss a few good resources for you to review periodically. What excites me about the security profession is the constant evolution of the industry. Take the OWASP Top 10, for example. Earlier in the program, we discussed the fact that this is a globally recognized standard awareness document that lists the top"
3EgYr7jR4NI,24,"we discussed the fact that this is a globally recognized standard awareness document that lists the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications. This list is updated every three to four years. So it's a great example of the evolving nature of the field. Continuing your security education beyond this certificate program will help you stand out to hiring managers and could give you an extra edge over other candidates because it shows your willingness to remain current on what's happening in the industry. A few well-known security websites and blogs to get you started are CSO Online, Krebs on Security, and Dark Reading. The CSO Online site provides news, analysis, and research on various security and risk management topics. Many CISOs view this site for tips and ideas. It would be great for you to review this publication every now and then. Krebs on Security is an in-depth security blog created by former ""Washington Post"" reporter Brian Krebs. This blog covers security news and investigations into various cyber attacks. Accessing the Krebs blog is a good way to stay up to date on the latest security news and happenings around the world. Dark Reading is a popular website for security professionals. This site provides information about various security topics, like analytics and application security, mobile and cloud security, as well as the Internet of Things, IoT. Security is a constantly evolving industry. As professionals in security, we must evolve with it by seeking out new information. Be sure to explore a few of the websites and blogs we discussed in this video to stay up to date with what's happening in the industry. Coming up, we'll discuss how to become engaged with the security community and ways to establish and advance your career and security. Bye for now. Earlier, we discussed the importance of staying up to date on"
3EgYr7jR4NI,25,"the importance of staying up to date on security trends and news. In this video, we're going to share ways to establish and advance your career and security by connecting with people who are already in the industry. Social media is a great way to connect to other security professionals in the industry. However, it's important to be mindful of the information you share on your social media page and when responding to messages from people you don't know. With that in mind, let's discuss ways to effectively use social media to establish or advance your security career. One way to use social media is to follow or read the posts of leaders in the security industry. Chief information security officers, for example, are great individuals to follow. They often post interviews they've done in the security space and share articles they've read or contributed to. Here's a question you might be asking yourself. How can I find CISOs to follow on social media? The best way would be to conduct an internet search for the name of the CISO of a popular organization or an organization you're interested in working for. After you find their name, you can simply go to a social media site to look them up. Ideally, you want to use LinkedIn when following security professionals. That's because the LinkedIn platform focuses on connecting professionals with other professionals in the same or similar field. Another way to use social media to establish or advance your career in the security industry is to connect with other security analysts currently employed in the field. On social networks like LinkedIn, you can find security professionals by searching for cybersecurity analysts or a similar search term, then filtering for people and people who talk about hashtag #cybersecurity. Once you've found other professionals you'd like to connect with, you"
3EgYr7jR4NI,26,"other professionals you'd like to connect with, you can send a connection request with a brief comment, such as, hi, I'd like to connect to learn more about why you became interested in security and your experiences as an analyst. Additionally, you can set your filter to locate events and groups that focus on security-related topics that interest you. While social media platforms like LinkedIn are excellent for connecting with professionals, some people are more comfortable with being active on social media than others. For those of us who aren't very active on social media, there are other ways to connect with security professionals or find mentors in the industry. Joining different security associations is a good way to connect with others. There are many associations out there. So you're going to have to do a little bit of research to find the best ones for you. Here's a tip. In your internet search engine, type cybersecurity industry associations. This search term will populate a variety of different associations. So be sure to select ones that align with your professional goals. Now that we've discussed ways to engage with the security community, consider following a CISO on LinkedIn, connecting with other analysts, or searching for cybersecurity organizations to join. That's all for now. I'll meet you in the next video. Great job. Now you've had an opportunity to learn about different ways to stay engaged with the security community. Let's take a moment to review what we've covered. First, we identified reliable security resources. Then we discussed different ways to engage with the security community. We also explored the usefulness of social media to connect with other security professionals and stay informed about current topics of interest.

3EgYr7jR4NI,27,"to establish and advance a career in security, including following a CISO on social media or joining a professional organization. We've come a long way in this journey. You should be proud of your progress and how far you've come. I'm certainly proud of you. In the final section of this course, we'll take the time to prepare you for the job search and interviewing process. How exciting is that? Welcome back. We've covered so many security-related topics in detail. Throughout this program, we've discussed protecting organizational assets and data and the tools and procedures used to protect them. We've also explored how to communicate with stakeholders, reliable sources to help you stay up to date on security news and trends, and ways to get involved with the security community to help establish and advance your career in the field. Now we need to get you prepared to find a job as an entry-level security analyst. Security is a huge field with countless job opportunities. By 2030, the US Bureau of Labor statistics expects the number of security roles to grow by more than 30%. But how can you find the right opportunity for you? In the next several videos, we'll discuss specific strategies to help you find and apply for jobs in the industry, including how to create your resume and develop rapport with interviewers. We'll also cover how to use the STAR method for interviewing and how to develop an elevator pitch. | remember initially being interested in my role because education is my passion. Researching the security field and industry in preparation for my interviews cemented my fascination for cybersecurity. I'll be honest, I had taken a lot of what security does for granted. Now I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of this industry and the exciting opportunities it offers. Now it's time to get you"
3EgYr7jR4NI,28,"the exciting opportunities it offers. Now it's time to get you ready to find security jobs. Let's get started. I hope you feel really proud of how far you've come. You may remember that earlier in this program, we discussed a few security roles in the industry. Now we'll explore three of those roles. We'll start with security analyst. Security analyst is typically an entry-level role that might interest you as you prepare to enter the security field. The role generally focuses on monitoring networks for security breaches, developing strategies to help secure an organization, and even researching IT security trends. In previous courses, we discussed log monitoring and SIEM tools. Having a solid foundational understanding of how to use those tools will certainly be useful in this role. Another role that might interest you is information security analyst. This role generally focuses on creating plans and implementing security measures to protect organizations, networks, and systems. Earlier in the program, you learned about controls and frameworks that can be used to develop security plans and procedures, as well as how to use SIEMs and packet sniffers to identify risks. That knowledge will be beneficial when it comes to developing plans and determining the best tools to strengthen an organization's security posture. Finally, we'll explore the security operations center analyst role. Security Operations Center analyst, also known as a SOC analyst, is another role you might find exciting. This role generally focuses on ensuring security incidents are handled rapidly and efficiently by following established policies and procedures. Earlier in this program, we discussed security playbooks and how they are unique to each organization. We also covered the importance of being able to follow the processes outlined in playbooks to respond to security events or incidents. That knowledge will certainly help you stand out as a potential"
3EgYr7jR4NI,29,"security events or incidents. That knowledge will certainly help you stand out as a potential candidate for this role. There are many more job roles that you may be interested in. A great way to find more of these roles is to create an account on various job sites and search for cybersecurity positions. A few well-known job sites in the United States and internationally are ZipRecruiter, Indeed, and Monster Jobs. Each of these sites have hundreds of open job listings with roles, responsibilities, and skill set requirements posted under the job title. How exciting is it that we're now discussing jobs and sites that you can use to apply for them? It's important that you do your research before applying to any position. Gather plenty of information about the company, the job role, as well as required and preferred skills. This will help prepare you for a potential interview by knowing exactly what the employer is looking for and how your skills align with the employer's expectations. This will also help you align your own values and passions with the organization's mission and vision. But before you can apply for a security job, it's important to create a resume that will catch an employer's attention. Coming up, we'll discuss the resume development process in detail. In this video, we'll discuss how to create a resume that is tailored to the job you're applying for. Note that a resume is sometimes called a Curriculum Vitae, or CV for short. Remember that it's OK if you don't have any cybersecurity experience. This certificate program has covered key skills and concepts that employers are looking for in an entry-level security analyst position. You can mention all that you've learned in this program on your resume, including programming languages such as Python and SQL and Linux line-command. You can also share your understanding of what it means"
3EgYr7jR4NI,30,"your understanding of what it means to have a security mindset, your knowledge of standard frameworks and controls like the NIST CSF and CIA triad model, as well as your familiarity with how to use SIEM tools and packet sniffers. It's also possible that some of your earlier job experiences allowed you to develop knowledge and skills that are transferable to a security role. These skills could include being detail-oriented, collaborative, and having strong written and verbal communication skills. Here's an example of a resume. You'll want to start with your name at the top of the resume followed by your professional title. Your title could be something like security analyst or a title that matches the position you're applying for. You'll also want to include at least one way that employers or recruiters can contact you, for example, an email address or phone number. After your name and title, you'll provide a summary statement. This section should be brief, just one or two sentences related to your strengths and relevant skills. Make sure the statement includes specific words from the Responsibility section of the job description. You can include something like this in your statement. ""I am a motivated security analyst seeking an entry-level cybersecurity position to apply my skills in network security, security policy, and organizational risk management."" Following your name and summary statement is the Skills section. This is a bulleted list of the skills you've learned in this program that are related to the position. Employers usually like to know about your previous work experience. In the Experience section, you'll list your work history. Underneath each job entry, provide a list of the skills and responsibilities you performed. It's a good idea to start each bullet with a verb and, if possible, details that quantify an"
3EgYr7jR4NI,31,"start each bullet with a verb and, if possible, details that quantify an accomplishment, for example, ""Collaborated with a team of six to develop training for more than 25 company employees."" Try to highlight the security or technology-related skills and knowledge that you have based on your experiences in previous jobs and this certificate program. The next section of the resume lists your education and certifications. Start with the most recent education you've completed, including certifications, trade schools, online courses, or college experience. Also include the names of sites and organizations that issued your certifications and schools you attended. List any subjects you studied related to the job you're applying for. If you're currently enrolled in school or a certification program but haven't graduated, note, in progress. As you develop your resume, keep a couple of things in mind. Make sure there are no spelling or grammatical errors in your resume before sending it to your potential employer. Also note that resumes are typically about two pages long and list only your last 10 years or less of work experience. Resumes can be created using word processing applications like Google Docs or OpenOffice. However, you might find some simple but professional resume templates online to get you started. To find them, type, ""free resume template"" or a similar search term into your internet browser. If you use a template, be sure to replace all of the prefilled text with your information and qualifications. There is so much to consider when creating your resume. But what we covered today will help you get started. Coming up, we'll explore the interview process. After you've submitted your resume to several job postings, you'll hopefully get an opportunity for an interview. The interview process usually starts with a short prescreening phone call. It typically involves having"
3EgYr7jR4NI,32,"usually starts with a short prescreening phone call. It typically involves having a 15-minute conversation with a hiring manager or recruiter who will ask you some questions to make sure that you are who your resume says you are and that you meet the minimum requirements for the job. Following the prescreening, you could be invited to an in-person interview, either on site or online. This could be a panel interview with a few members of the team that you would be working with or a one-on-one interview. Let's discuss some strategies that can help prepare you for an interview. Review the job description and your resume ahead of time. Practice speaking about the experiences and skills that the employer is looking for. Consider practicing this with a friend by participating in a mock interview. Your friend will act as the interviewer, and you will answer their questions as if you're meeting with the employer. It can also be helpful to dress professionally and feel comfortable in the clothes you choose to wear for the interview. Before the interview begins, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself of all the preparation you've done. If the interview is online via video conference, prepare a location in your home that is quiet, tidy, and professional. Also be sure to test your video and audio settings and, if necessary, download the video conference application specified by the interviewer. This will help ensure that you correct any technical issues before the interview. Interviews usually include two parts, a background interview and a technical interview. The background interview will likely include questions about your education, work experience, skills, and abilities. You might even be asked some personal questions unrelated to the job posting. The interviewer is trying to get to know you to determine if you'll be a good match for the team and company culture. At the same time, you"
3EgYr7jR4NI,33,"be a good match for the team and company culture. At the same time, you want to ask questions to help you decide if the team and company culture are a good match for you. The other portion of the interview is the technical interview. This is when the interviewer will ask you specific questions about technical skills related to the role. You might be asked how you would respond to a specific situation or to explain a technical concept that's listed on your resume. Do your best to answer these types of questions confidently and concisely based on your current knowledge. It's OK to say that you don't know the answer to a question or that you need a moment to respond so you can think about your answer. Employers respect honesty. Just follow up with an explanation of how you would figure out the answer, either by researching it or collaborating with the team. Even after you've completed this certificate program, you'll still have access to all of the content. So before the interview, go back and review your notes, the glossary, and any concepts that you might need to refresh your memory on. This can help you feel prepared for the questions you'll be asked. Remember, you can prepare for the interview by participating in a mock interview, reviewing the job description, and taking a few deep breaths before the interview begins. You've learned a lot in this course and are ready to move ahead and find a position as a security analyst. Coming up, we'll discuss how to conduct pre-intervew research. Previously, we discussed how to create a resume and what to expect during an interview. In this video, we're going to cover a few more things that you need to do to prepare for the interview and that could help set you apart as an excellent candidate"
3EgYr7jR4NI,34,"prepare for the interview and that could help set you apart as an excellent candidate for the position. Before the interview, it's important to do some research about the organization you're interviewing with. Interviewers want to know that you're a good match for their team and that you value the things that are important to the company. It's just as important for you to decide if the company matches your values. So make sure you know the organization's mission and vision. Understand their core values and company culture. This information is usually easy to find, either in the job description or on the About page of the organization's website. Think about why these values and the company culture are also important to you. Then practice how you will communicate this to potential employers. Remember that you will not be the only applicant for the position. Consider what sets you apart from other candidates, and be prepared to emphasize those qualities during the interview. What about your skills, experience, or work ethic make you the best match for this position? How do your goals align to the goals of the organization? You want the employer to remember you after they've interviewed several candidates. So highlight things that make you the best candidate for the role. You also want to think about the employer's perspective. The organization has needs that must be met by filling the position. They may have productivity or compliance goals, or the team might be growing because the company is expanding. Take some time to think about what the interviewer is seeking in a candidate. Then prepare yourself to state directly how you can meet the employer's needs. The interviewer may have reservations about hiring you because of your lack of experience as a security analyst. If this comes up in the interview, be prepared to address any possible concerns by speaking about your strong work ethic. This could include an ability to"
3EgYr7jR4NI,35,"possible concerns by speaking about your strong work ethic. This could include an ability to learn quickly based on feedback or to collaborate and communicate with others. Also, you could discuss having a security mindset or problem-solving skills that you've developed from personal life, work, or educational experiences. Learning about the organization's culture and mission and preparing to demonstrate how you can add value to the team are essential. It's also a good idea to write down questions that you can ask the interviewer about the organization's past accomplishments and future goals. This shows potential employers that you've done your research and care about the organization's success. Coming up, we'll discuss how to build rapport with interviewers. In this video, we'll explore a topic that can contribute to your success during the interview process-- how to build rapport with your potential employer. Rapport is a friendly relationship in which the people involved understand each other's ideas and communicate well with each other. Building rapport begins with the very first interaction you have with the company staff by phone, email, or video conference. It's important to use a professional tone in the email you write expressing your interest in the job. But it's also important to be polite and friendly. Expressing appreciation for being considered and having the potential opportunity to interview is one way to build rapport. When and if you have an initial phone screen, you can use a friendly, conversational tone of voice. To do this, try smiling while you talk. And while it's true that nobody can see you smile on a phone call, smiling while you talk can make you sound friendlier. During the phone screening and in-person interview, you can ease interview nervousness by engaging actively in a way that feels natural to you. That can mean simply saying,"
3EgYr7jR4NI,36,"that feels natural to you. That can mean simply saying, hello, nice to meet you. You can even start a short, friendly conversation by asking the interviewer how their day is going. Or if the weekend just passed, you might ask the interviewer, how was your weekend? Make eye contact when you ask these questions during an in-person interview. Or be sure to look directly into the camera during a video interview. This will show the interviewer that you're engaged in the conversation. Oftentimes during the second half of an interview, the interviewer will ask if you have any questions for them. As we discussed earlier, it's important to have some questions prepared to ask at this point. Here are some suggestions. You could ask, what is the biggest challenge I might face coming into this role, and how would I be expected to meet that challenge? Or you might ask, what would you say is the best part about working for this company? Or what is a typical day like for an analyst? Another great question is, what is the potential for growth in this role? Asking questions shows that you're engaged in the conversation and are interested in the company and the position. It also shows the employer that you are confident and that you want to make sure that their company is a good match for you before you make a commitment. It's nice to send a follow-up email a day or two after your in-person interview. This is just a brief email thanking the interviewer for the opportunity to meet with them and learn more about the organization. It's also a good idea to mention something specific from your interview in this email. It shows that you were actively engaged in the conversation. Remember, the employer is probably interviewing other candidates. So sending a"
3EgYr7jR4NI,37,"employer is probably interviewing other candidates. So sending a follow-up email will help set you apart and remind the interviewer of your discussion. Building rapport with the interviewer and other employees is an important skill when interviewing for your first security position. Writing friendly but professional emails before and after the interview and engaging in friendly conversation during the interview can help set you apart as a great candidate for the job. Welcome back. Preparing for job interviews in the security field is such an exciting process. You've learned a lot through this program that can help you stand out as a candidate. Let's discuss some useful interview strategies to consider when speaking to an employer. Your interviewer is going to ask several questions when you meet. Carefully consider each question before responding. Let's discuss the STAR method, which can help you prepare for interviews. The STAR method is a technique used to answer behavioral and situational interview questions. Using this method is a great way to help you understand each interview question and provide a thoughtful and thorough response. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result. The STAR method is typically used to answer open-ended questions, such as, tell me about a time when you encountered a challenge on the job. Let's go through an example of how this question could be answered using the STAR method. The situation-- two people needed to stay home from work due to illness, and I was the only person available to assist customers. The task-- I needed to answer phone calls from customers while assisting shoppers in the store. The action-- I came up with a strategy that allowed me to assist customers as they entered the store while also ensuring that customers who called were helped or politely placed on hold until I was able to address their needs. The result-- I managed the"
3EgYr7jR4NI,38,"to address their needs. The result-- I managed the in-store operations for the day without many mistakes, and my manager complimented me during the next team meeting. Hopefully this example highlights the benefits of answering open-ended interview questions using the STAR method. But the STAR method isn't the only strategy you can use during an interview. You can also answer questions with confidence. One way to demonstrate confidence is by admitting when you don't know something. For example, if an interviewer asks you to discuss a skill that you don't have, it's OK to admit you haven't learned it yet. However, the trick is to confidently mention that, while you don't have that particular skill, you're a quick learner and eager to develop that skill. Treat it as an opportunity to emphasize your ability to adapt and learn on the job, which shows confidence. You know what else shows confidence? Taking the time to fully understand a problem or question to provide the best solution or answer possible. When interviewing, don't be afraid to ask the interviewer for a moment to think about your answer. It shows that you're willing to take the time needed to understand the question and provide a response that is meaningful and relevant. We've discussed a few strategies that can help you overcome the nervousness you may feel about interviewing for a job. Coming up, we'll continue to explore ways to prepare for interviews. In this video, we'll take a little time to discuss additional strategies you can use during a job interview. In past job interviews, your potential employer may have asked, do you have any questions for me? This type of question can be an opportunity for you to show the interviewer that you're prepared and ready to have"
3EgYr7jR4NI,39,"interviewer that you're prepared and ready to have a meaningful conversation with them. A big part of interview preparation is researching the company before the interview because it will allow you to ask questions that demonstrate you took the time to learn about the organization and its needs. For example, if you discover that the company suffered a major security breach two years ago, don't be afraid to ask about it. One question you could ask is, what do you think is the main reason the company suffered a breach two years ago? And follow that question up with, how could my role on the security team help prevent a breach like that in the future? These kinds of questions show that you are passionate about your career and that you want to help the company strengthen its security posture. There are also some general questions you can ask the interviewer to determine if the job and the organization itself are a good match for you. Here are some examples. What's the biggest challenge for a new person in this role? In what ways can I contribute to the success of the team and the organization? What qualities or traits are most important for working well with the team and other stakeholders? Questions like these can help you develop rapport with the interviewer and show that you're interested in learning more about the role and the organizational culture. Interviewing for jobs can be a really exciting process when you're prepared, and asking questions is an essential part of the interview process. Don't be afraid to ask potential employers tough questions. This will help them understand you as a thoughtful, curious person who can add value to the team. Coming up, we'll discuss another strategy-- the elevator pitch. Now let's discuss a concept that can help you identify your strengths and allow you"
3EgYr7jR4NI,40,"that can help you identify your strengths and allow you to highlight those strengths to others-- an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a brief summary of your experience, skills, and background. It's called an elevator pitch because it should be short enough to say in 60 seconds or less, which is the average amount of time you might spend talking with someone on an elevator. Elevator pitches allow you to demonstrate who you are to potential employers in a very short time span. They can be used at job fairs, career expos, and other networking situations, like professional conferences and social media job sites, such as LinkedIn. Now let's examine how to create an elevator pitch. Your elevator pitch needs to be short and persuasive. There's no need to list all of your previous experiences and accomplishments. Instead, explain who you are and why you care about being a security professional, as well as the qualifications and skills you have that are specifically related to getting a job as a security analyst. For example, critical thinking, problem solving, and the ability to build collaborative relationships with others are transferable skills that most organizations are looking for. So highlight those in your elevator pitch. You could also mention technical skills you've learned in this certificate program, such as using various SIEM tools and programming languages like SQL and Python to identify and respond to risks. Now we'll cover a few things to avoid when delivering your elevator pitch. It's important to avoid rambling or sharing irrelevant details during your elevator pitch. Potential employers only want to know who you are and why they should consider you for a security role. As you develop your elevator pitch, you're going to want to practice it several times. However, don't practice it so much that you end up sounding ingenuine or robotic when it's time to"
3EgYr7jR4NI,41,"practice it so much that you end up sounding ingenuine or robotic when it's time to share your pitch with a possible decision-maker. Instead, speak naturally, like you're having a conversation, when you give your elevator pitch. That will help keep people engaged and interested in what you're saying. Another thing to avoid-- speaking too quickly. Because an elevator page is fairly short, it can be easy to rush through it. But that can cause people to miss out on some key skills you have to offer simply because you sped past them. One last tip-- search the internet for elevator pitches to find examples that may help you generate ideas for your own pitch. In essence, your elevator pitch is a way to tell people why you are an amazing candidate for a security position, with great skills and a clear direction for what you want to do in your career. While it's natural to be nervous when speaking to potential employers, just remember, take a deep breath, gather your composure, and deliver your pitch with confidence, conviction, and at a normal pace. You'll be just fine. You've done a great job completing this section of the course. Let's take a moment to review what we've covered.

_AadMC3mzSk,1,in this video we will break down every single acronym you need to know for the Security Plus exam from AAA to xss we will not only Define them but also explain them with real world examples and visuals to make them stick so grab a notebook hit that like button and let's dive into the Ultimate Security Plus acronym guide that will simplify your study Journey Tria a that is authentication authorization and accounting so authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user device or a system to ensure that only authorized entities gain access to resources examples it typically involve validating credential such as passwords that is something you know it is a type of authenticating factor that is something you know biometric such as fingerprint which is the authenticating factor type something you are or security token which is which is the authenticating factor type something you have similarly authorization authorization is the process of determining and granting a user's permission to access specific resources performs certain actions or use particular Services based B on their verified identity authorization usually takes place after authentication so typically user first logs in using the authenticating factor such as username and password and then the user is able to perform certain action as per their authorization and the third one is accounting accounting or auditing refers to tracking and recording a user's activity such as access to resources performed actions and system usage example include login and log out logs command execution logs Etc that is Access Control list so a list of rules that controls who can access or modify resources like files or network devices it defines permissions for users or systems based on criteria such as IP headers or user identity example include a firewall ACL blocks traffic from suspicious IP addresses AES that is Advanced encryption standard so a secure encryption method used to protect data by transforming it into a into an unreadable format it uses symmetric Keys meaning the same key is used for encryption and decryption examples as is commonly used for securing Wi-Fi networks and encryption of sensitive files ah that is authentication header so authentication header is a protocol in the IP sex suit that provides data integrity and authentication for IP packets it ensures
_AadMC3mzSk,2,"header is a protocol in the IP sex suit that provides data integrity and authentication for IP packets it ensures that the data has not been altered and when ifies the sender's identity but does not encrypt the content examples ah is used in secure VPN connections to validate packet authenticity AI that is artificial intelligence so AI artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines allowing them to perform tasks that typically require human cognition such as learning problem solving and decision making examples include chatbots like chat gbt and Gemini AI in cyber security can analyze patterns to detect unusual activi such as identifying potential threats based on previous Behavior AIS that is automated indicator sharing so AIS that is automated automated indicating sharing is a system that enables the automated exchange of cyber threat indicators such as IP addresses URLs and file hashes between organizations and government entities to improve cyber security AIS is designed to help identify and respond to cyber threats more quickly by sharing realtime threat intelligence example us s uses AIS to share cyber security threat indicators with private sector Partners to enhance protection against emerging threats a that is analized loss expectancy so Al is a risk management metric used to estimate the potential Financial loss an organization could face due to a specific risk over the course of a year it helps organizations prioritize their risk mitigation efforts by quantifying potential losses so the formula for a is a is equal to a that is annual rate of occurrence multiplied by SLE that is single loss expectancy so let's suppose for example if an an organization expects a data breach to occur five times every year that means that annual rate of occurrence or ar is five and the estimated loss from a bridge is 1,000 that is SLE is $1,000 then the AL would be 5 thou 5 time $1,000 that is $5,000 this means the organization can expect a potential loss of $5,000 per year from that specific risk AP that is access point so access point is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wir network using Wi-Fi or other Wireless standards it serves"
_AadMC3mzSk,3,device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wir network using Wi-Fi or other Wireless standards it serves as a central hub for communication between wireless devices like laptop or smart phones and the network extending the Network's range and providing Wireless connectivity example a Wi-Fi router is a home network in a home network acts as an access point enabling devices like smartphones laptops and smart TVs to connect wirelessly to the internet API that is application programming interface API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other it defines the method and data formats that programs can use to request and exchange information example payment systems like PayPal provides apis that allow websites to process transactions securely without needing to handle payment information directly AP that is advanced persistent threat so AP Advanced position threat refers to prolonged and targeted Cyber attack where an an attacker gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for a extended period APS are typically carried out by highly skilled and organized threat actors often the specific objectives such such as often with specific objectives such as Espino data theft or sabotage example include a nation state actor might launch an AP against a government agency to steal sensitive information over several months or years so these are the properties of AP they are targeted persistent complex and evasive AO that is analyzed rate of occurrence so AO or annualized rate of occurrence is the risk management metric that estimates how often a a specific risk or threat is expected to occur in a year it helps organizations quantify the frequency of potential incidents which can be used to calculate the annualized Lost expectancy that is a example if a network outage is expected to happen three times per year then the AR would be three ARP that is addressed resolution protocol the ARP address resolution protocol is a network protocol used to map a devices IP address to its physical Mac that is Media Access Control address on a local network it enable devices to communicate within a local area network Lan by translating IP address into Mech address which are required for proper data transmission for example if a device tries to communicate with IP address 192168
_AadMC3mzSk,4,are required for proper data transmission for example if a device tries to communicate with IP address 192168 1.10 but does not know the corresponding Mac address it sends an RP request asking who has 192168 1.10 the device with that IP address will respond with its Mac address aslr that is address space layout randomization the aslr address space layout randomization is a security technique used to randomize the memory address used by system and application processes by changing the locations of key data structures such as the stake Heap and shared libraries it makes it more difficult for attackers to predict the memory layout and exploit vulnerabilities like buffer overflows example if an attacker tries to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability aslr would cause the attackers crafted input to fail because the expected memory locations for exploiting the bug are different or in on each execution attack that is adversarial tactics techniques and common knowledge so attack that is adversarial tactics techniques and common knowledge is a comprehensive knowledge base used by cyber security profession to describe the actions and behavior of cyber adversaries it it categorizes and documents the tactics the why or objectives techniques the how or methods and procedures that is specific actions used by attackers during cyber attacks helping organizations understand and defend against threats example M attack framework is a frequently used to map out and assess non adversity behavior in various environments like Enterprise networks Cloud infrastructure and mobile platforms AUP that is acceptable use policy so a is a set of rules and guidelines created by an organization to define acceptable and unacceptable behavior when using its network devices or online services example an organization AUP might prohibit employees from using company email for personal purposes downloading unauthorized software or accessing inappropriate websites a that is antivirus so AV or antivirus refers to software designed to detect prevent and remove malicious software that is malware from computers and networks a software typically scans files programs and E males for signs of viruses warms spy wear and other forms of malware example a user install a software like Norton or MFE to protect their personal computer from malware and prevent potential infection from downloaded files or email attachments
_AadMC3mzSk,5,or MFE to protect their personal computer from malware and prevent potential infection from downloaded files or email attachments bash that is Born Again shell so bash Born Again shell is a command line interface and scripting language for Unix based operating system such as Linux and Mac OS it serves as a shell for intera interacting with the operating system allowing users to execute commands run scripts and automate tasks example in a terminal you can use best to run commands like LS that is to list files or CD that is used to change directories BCP that is business continuity planning the BCP that is business continuity plan is a strategy and set of procedures designed to ensure that an organization can continue operating during and after a disaster or disruptive event example a data center may have a BCP that includes backup Power Systems offside data storage and Disaster Recovery protocols to ensure service continuity during power outages or natural disasters Bia that is business impact analysis the Bia business impact analysis is a process used to identify and evaluate the potential effects of disruption to an organization's critical operations it helps prioritize business functions and resources to ensure that essential Services can continue during and after a disaster or disruption example a financial institution May perform a Bia to assess the potential impact of data loss or downtime on traing systems ensuring that recovery plans are in plan to minimize financial and reputational damage bios that is basic input output system the BIOS basic input output system is a firware embedded in a computer's motherboard that initializes Hardware components during the bootup process and provides an interface between the operating system and the hardware it performs basic system checks and loads the operating system for from Storage example when you power on your computer the BIOS performs a power on self test that is posted to check for hardware issues such as faulty Ram are missing hard drive BP a that is business partner agreement the BPA business partners agreement is a formal contract between two or more organizations that outlines the terms and conditions of their business relationships it typically includes details and roles responsibilities Financial agreements intellectual property confidentiality and dispute resolution example a software development company
_AadMC3mzSk,6,it typically includes details and roles responsibilities Financial agreements intellectual property confidentiality and dispute resolution example a software development company might sign a BPA with Within marketing Farm to collaborate on logic and new product specifying Revenue sharing marketing strategies and giant responsibilities bpdu that is Bridge protocol data unit the bpdu bridge protocol data unit is a type of network message used by spanning tree protocol STP to maintain the loop free topology in Ethernet networks bpdus help network Network switches communicate and decide the best paths for data to travel preventing Network Loops by determining the root bridge and other important topology details example a network say switch sends bpdu to other switches to exchange information about the Network's topology ensuring all devices have a consistent view of the network and can adjust to changes like link failures or new switches CA that that is certificate Authority so CS certificate Authority is an organization or entity that issues digital certificates to verify the ownership of public keys this certificate ensure secure Communications by establishing trust between parties such as in HTTPS connections example let's encrypt a widely used CA issues free ssl/tls certificate Ates to websites to enable secure https connections capture that is completely automated public touring test to tell computers and humans apart so capture that is completely automated public during test to tell computers and human apart is a security mechanism used to distinguish between humans and automated Bots it prevents bot from performing action such as spamming forms creating fake accounts or overloading servers example when signing up for an online service you might be asked to solve a capture by selecting all images containing traffic lights this ensures that only human can complete the task blocking BS from automated registration car that is correct Ive action report so C correction corrective action report is a document used to identify and resolve issues within a process system or product it outlines the problem its root cause and the steps taken to prevent it from happening again in the future example after a security breach in an organization a car may be prepared to document the cause of the breach that is outdated softare Ware the corrective action for example software updates and employee training and measur
_AadMC3mzSk,7,breach that is outdated softare Ware the corrective action for example software updates and employee training and measur to avoid future breaches for example regular page management casb or CB that is cloud access security broker so casb or Cloud access security broker is a security solution that sits between users and cloud service providers to mon and enforce security policies it helps organizations secure their data ensure compliance and protect against threats when using Cloud application example a company uses a casb to monitor employ employee access to cloud storage services like Google drive or one drive ensuring sensitive data is not shared externally without proper authorization casbs can also enforce encryption detect unusual activity and block block access to unapproved Cloud application to enhance security CBC that is cipher blockchaining CBC Cipher blockchaining is a model of operation for Block ciphers in cryptography it encrypts data in fixed sized blocks where each block is exor with the cipher text of the previous block before being in encrypted this process adds dependency between blocks enhancing security example CBC is used in protocols like TLS older versions for encrypting data during secure communication ccmp that is counter mode cbc-mac protocol so ccmp is an encryption protocol used in wifi security it is part of the w P2 that is Wi-Fi protected access to standard and provides strong confidentiality integrity and authentication ccmp is based on the AES that is Advanced encryption standard algorithm example ccmp encrypts data transmitted or a Wi-Fi network to protect it from a dropping and tempering CCTV that is closed circuit television CCTV is a video surveillance system that uses cameras to transmit video signals to a specific set of monitors or recording devices unlike broadcast television CCTV is a closed system meaning the footage is only accessible to authorized users example security monitoring businesses use CCTV cameras to monitor entrances exits and sensitive areas for unauthorized access or theft traffic manag M cities use CCTV to monitor traffic flow and enforce traffic laws at intersections s that is computer Emergency Response Team so sech computer emergency sport team is a group of experts responsible for handling and responding to cyber security incidents such as malware outbreaks
_AadMC3mzSk,8,sport team is a group of experts responsible for handling and responding to cyber security incidents such as malware outbreaks fishing attacks or data breaches they work to mitigate risk investigate incident and develop strategies to prevent future threats example user that is United State computer emergency Readiness team this team monitors and respond to National cyber security incidents providing alerts and guidance to organizations CIA that is confidentiality integrity and availability so CIA confidentiality integrity and availability is a foundational model in cyber security that guides the protection of information it focuses on ensuring that data is secure from unauthorized access remains accurate and unaltered and is available when needed confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to VI it example includ encrypting sensitive data so that only authorized users can read it Integrity ensures that the information is accurate and has not been tempered with example using hash function to verify that a file has not been modified availability ensures that information is accessible and usable when needed example implementing redundancy and backup system to ensure data is accessible even during system failures cioo that is Chief Information officer the CIO Chief Information officer is an executive responsible for overseeing and managing and organizations Information Technology strategy and operations the CIO ensures that it systems and infrastructure support the business's goals security and performance example a CIO in a large corporation may lead initiatives to upgrade the company's software and Hardware improve cyber security practices and ensure that it aligns with business objectives in a startup the CIO might focus on cloud Solutions and cost effective it management supporting the company's rapid growth and Innovation s cirt computer incident response team so CT that is computer incident response team is a group of IT professional and cyber security expert responsible for responding to and managing security incidents they are tossed with identifying investigating and mitigating the effects of cyber attacks or breaches to minimize damage and recover system example after a fishing attack a CT might investigate how the attackers gained access contain the bridge restore effective affected system and develop strategies to prevent future incidents CMS that is content management system the CMS that is content management system is a software application that allows users to
_AadMC3mzSk,9,that is content management system the CMS that is content management system is a software application that allows users to create manage and modify digital content on a website without requiring specialized technical knowledge it simplifies website management by providing tools for Content creation editing and Publishing example what WordPress is a popular CMS that enables individuals and businesses to easily build and manage websites blogs and online stores without needing to write code Coupe or cop that is continuity of operation planning so coup continuity of operation planning is a strategy that ensures an organization can continue its critical function during and after a dis faster or disruption the plan outlines procedures to maintain essential Services recover from crisis and minimize operational downtime example a government agency might have a coup that includes emergency relocation procedures relocation procedures backup system for essential records and communication strategies to ensure continue service during a natural disaster cope that is corporate owned personally enabled so C that is corporate owned personally enabled is a mobile device management policy where an organization provides employees with company owned devices that they are allowed to use for both businesses and personal purposes the devices are typically configured with security measures to ensure data protection while providing employees some flexibility example a company May issue smartphones to employees as part of a cop strategy allowing employees to use them for work related tasks such as email video conferencing and access to Company applications while also permitting personal use like browsing or social media all while enforcing security controls like remote web or app management CP that is contingency planning so CP contingency planning is the process of developing strategies and procedures to ensure that an organization can continue operation can continue operating during and after unexpected disruption such as natural disaster cyber attacks or system failures it involves a preparing for potential risks by identifying critical functions and creating plans to recover them example A Bank might have a contingency plan that includes backup power supplies data recovery protocols and a communication strategy to maintain operations if their primary data center goes offline CRC that is cyclical cyclical redundancy check so CRC is an error detecting code used to ensure the Integrity of data during transmission or storage it involves generating a check sum from the data which is then transmitted along
_AadMC3mzSk,10,of data during transmission or storage it involves generating a check sum from the data which is then transmitted along with the data the receiver recalculates the CRC value and Compares it to the transmitted checkm to detect errors example Network transmission when sending files over the Internet a CRC V is calculated for the file and sent along with the data the recipient computes the CRC of the received data and compare it to the original value to check for the corruption during transmission crl that is certificate revocation list so crl that is certificate revocation list is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked by a certificate Authority that is CA before their expiration date crls are used in public key infrastructure that is pki to ensure that certificates no longer in use are compromised are not trusted for secure communication example a web browser May check the crl to verify that a website's ssl/tls certificate is still valid and has not been revoked before establishing a secure connection CSO that is Chief security officer CSO Chief security officer is an executive responsible for overseeing and managing an organization security strategy policies and operations the CSO ensures the protection of the organization's physical and digital assets including cyber security physical security and risk management example a CSO in a large corporation may lead efforts to prevent data breaches manage cyber security incident and ensure compliance with security regulations CSP that is cloud service provider the CSP cloud service provider is a company or organization that offers cloud computing services including storage processing power software and other it resources over the Internet these Services allow businesses to scale their infrastructure without maintaining physical Hardware example Amazon web services that is AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are popular csps that provide services like cloud storage virtual servers and machine learning tools CSR that is certificate signing request the CSR certificate signing request is a block of encoded text sent to certificate Authority when applying for NSS for nssl or TLS certificate it contains information such as the organization's name domain name and public key which the ca uses to generate the certificate example when setting up a secure website that is https the website owner
_AadMC3mzSk,11,the ca uses to generate the certificate example when setting up a secure website that is https the website owner generate a CSR containing their public key and details about the organization which is then submitted to a CA like let's encrypt or commodo to obtain an SSL certificate csrf that is cross site request forgery csrf that is cross-site request fory is a type of attack where malicious attacker tricks a user into making an unwanted request to a web application that the user is authenticated on this can lead to action like changing account settings transferring money or other actions without the users consent example if a user is logged in into their online banking account an attacker could trick the user into clicking a link that initiates a fund transfer from the users's account to the attacker's account using the users authenticated session CSU that is channel Service Unit CSU is a device used in telecommunication networks to connect a customer's equipment like a router to a digital circuit typically a Leed line or digital subscriber line that is DSL it ensures that the signal quality is maintained and the data is properly transmitted between the customers premises and the service providers Network example in a T1 line setup a CSU is used to interface the customer router with the service providers digital Network ensuring that the signal is clean and meets the required specification for Reliable data transmission ctm that is counter mode so ctm counter mode is a mode of operation for Block ciphers in cryptography that turns a block Cipher into a stream F fiber Cipher in ctm mode a counter is used in conjunction with the blog Cipher to to encrypt data in a way that allows for parallel processing making it faster than other models like CBC example A- CTR when using AES in uh counter mode a counter is incremented for each block of data and the encrypted counter value is exor with the plain text to produce the cipher text this method ensures that the same plane text encrypted with the same key will result in different Cy taxs due to the changing counter CTO that is Chief technology officer so CTO Chief technology officer is
_AadMC3mzSk,12,due to the changing counter CTO that is Chief technology officer so CTO Chief technology officer is an executive responsible for overseeing the technology strategy and operations within an organization the CTU ensures that the company's technological infrastructure supports is business goals and Innovation they often lead the development of new technologies manag it teams and Align Technology Solutions with overall business strategies cve that is common vulnerability enumeration so cve common vulnerabilities and exposures is a system that provides a standardized way of identifying and naming publicly known cyber security vulnerabilities and exposure each cve entry is a assigned a unique identifier which helps security potential Security Professionals researchers and organization track and address security issues across various platforms and systems example cv-20 21- 34527 is a well-known vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Sprint spooler which allowed remote code execution by referencing this cve organization could quickly identify the issue and apply Pages or mitigations CVSs that is common vulnerability scoring system CVSs or common vulnerability scoring system is a standardized framework used to assess the severity of security V abilities in software or systems CVSs assigns and numerical scores from 0 to 10 to a vulnerability based on several Factor s such as exploitability impact and the complexity of an attack helping organizations prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first for example a cvsa score of 9 9.8 might indicate a critical meability that is easy to exploit and causes significant impact for example remote code execution while a cvsa score of 3.2 might represent a low severity vulnerability with minim minimal impact and complex exploitation requirements Cod that is choose your own device Cy or choose your own device is a policy where employees are allowed to select their own devices such as smartphones laptops or tablets from a pre-approved list provided by the organization the company May subsidize part of the cost but the employee is responsible for the devices maintenance and use within the company's security guidelines example a company might offer a company might offer employees a choice of several smartphone or laptops within a certain price range and brand allowing them to pick the one that suits
_AadMC3mzSk,13,of several smartphone or laptops within a certain price range and brand allowing them to pick the one that suits their preferences while ensuring that it meets the company's security standards such as the use of encryption and secure access controls deck discretionary Access Control deck discretionary access control is a type of Access Control policy where the owner of a resource such as a file or system has the discretion to decide who can access it and what actions they can perform for example read write and execute deck allows users to Grant or revoke permissions to other users or groups typically based on Identity or role example in a Windows operating system a user might own a file and can decide which other users or groups are allowed to access are modified the files owner has the discretion to get to set permission like read only or full access DBA that is database administrator DBA database administrator is a professional responsible for managing maintaining and securing databases within an organization dbaas ensure that databases are efficient reliable and available handling task like database design backup recovery security and performance tuning example a DBA can manage a DBA May manage a my SQL database for an e-commerce company ensuring that the data is backed up regularly optimizing the database for faster queries and implementing access controls to protect sensitive customer information DS that is distributed denial of service so this is an attack type what is DS dos distribut Beauty denial of service is a Cyber attack in which multiple compromised systems often part of a bot net or used to flood a Target such as a website or server with a massive amount of traffic overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users example during a DS attack a website might become slow or completely inaccessible due to an overwhelming number of request from thousands or millions of infected devices across the globe for instance an online retailer might experience aidos attack during a major sale causing their website to crash and preventing customers from making purchases DP dep that is data execution prevention so depth data execution prevention is a security feature that prevents code from being executed in certain regions of memory that are not designated for executable code it helps protect against attacks
_AadMC3mzSk,14,from being executed in certain regions of memory that are not designated for executable code it helps protect against attacks where malicious code attempts to execute from nonexecutable areas such as the stack or Heap which are typically used for data storage example dep would block a buffer overflow attack where an attacker tries to insert malicious code into the stack and executed if the attacker tries to run the code from a from a non-executable memory region adap will prevent the execution helping to safeguard against exploits like those used in viruses or wors D Dees that is digital encryption standard so what is Das D or data encryption standard is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that was widely used for securing data it uses a 56 bit key to encrypt decrypt data in block of 64 bits although desk was considered secure in the past it is now deemed weak due to advances in computational power and the ability to break the encryption through Brute Force attack example desk was used in various applications like securing Communications in financial transactions or encrypting data stored in databases for example desk was commonly used for encrypting data sensitive information in early online banking systems DHCP that is dynamic host configuration protocol so DHCP Dynamic host configur migration protocol is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings such as subnet mask default gway and DNS servers to devices on a network this eliminates the need for Network administrators to manually assign IP addresses to every device example when a device like a laptop or smartphone connects to a network work the DHCP server automatically assigns it an IP address from a predefined pool of available addresses this makes the process of joining a network seamless and efficient DHE that is Dey Helman Emeral so DHE that is Dey Helman ephemeral is a key exchange algorithm used in cryptography to securely exchange cryptographic keys or a public Channel in DH Emeral refers to the fact that the keys generated during the exchange are temporary and only used for a single session making the communication more secure by ensuring that keys are not reused example in an https connection DHE can be used to securely
_AadMC3mzSk,15,secure by ensuring that keys are not reused example in an https connection DHE can be used to securely establish a share secret between a client such as a web browser and a server this sec is used to encrypt the session and because the keys are ephemeral that is temporary even if the session keys are compromised later past Communications remain secure DKI M that is domain Keys identified mail so DK domain Keys identified mail is an email auth authentication method used to verify the legit intimacy of email messages it allows the sender to attach a cryptographic signature to an email message which recipients can use to verify that the email came from the claimed domain and has not been tempered with during transmission example when you send an email dkim adds a unique digital signature to the message header the recipient's mail server checks this signature against the public key stored in the domain's DNS records if the signature is valid it confirms that the email is authentic and has not been altered dll that is dynamic link Library so dll Dynamic link library is a type of file that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously it allows programs to share functionality reducing the amount of redundant code and saving memory dlls contain functions and procedures that applications can call when needed example a dll might contain functions for handling image processing and different applications like a photo editor or a web browser and call those functions without each application needing to have its own copy of code DLP that is data loss prevention so DLP is a set of Technologies policies and practices designed to prevent sensitive data from being accessed leaked or misused by unauthorized users or system it focuses on monitoring and controlling data in use that is active data in motion that is data being transferred and address that is data stored to ensure that confidential information is not inadvertently or maliciously exposed example in a company DLP software can prevent employees from copying sensitive documents to external USB drives or uploading them to unauthorized cloud storage Services thus reducing the risk of data breaches so DLP usually initially it discovers then monitors the data exfiltration and when when detected data
_AadMC3mzSk,16,breaches so DLP usually initially it discovers then monitors the data exfiltration and when when detected data exfiltration attempt or activity it prevents it DeMark that is domain message authentication reporting and confirmance so DeMark domain based message authentication reporting and confirmance is an email Authentication Protocol that helps protect against email spoofing and fishing example for example if an attacker tries to send a fake email from a company's domain Demar can help prevent the email from being delivered to users by rejecting or flagging it based on the domain owner policy dnet that is destination Network address translation soet destination Network address translation is a type of network address translation used to modify the destination IP address of packets as they pass through a router or firewall dnet is commonly used to follow request from an external network to an internal server such as when accessing a web server behind a router example for example if someone accesses the public IP address of your network on Port 80 that is HTTP dnet could forward that traffic to an internal servers private IP address that is 192168 and 1.10 allowing the web server to respond to the request DNS that is domain name system so DNS or domain name system is a system that translates human readable domain names like www.example.com into a machine readable IP addresses that is like 19216811 that computers use to identify each other on a network it essentially acts as the phone book of the internet enabling users to access website s using easy to remember domain names instead of numerical IP addresses example when you type www.google.com into your browser a DNS server resolve the domain name to the corresponding IP address for example 142 2501 9.78 allowing your browser to connect to the Google's web server dos that is denial of service so do denial of service is a type of Cyber attack aimed at disrupting the availability of a network system or service making it unusable for legitimate users this is typically achieved by overwhelming the target with a FL flood of traffic or by exploiting vulnerabilities that cause a system to crash
